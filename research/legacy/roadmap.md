# Minimum Viable Product
These features demonstrate everything needed for the basic gameplay loop. It
won't necessarily be a very fun game at this point, but gives an idea of the
potential once each of these barebones systems are fleshed out more.

1. A dude can fight another dude in standing melee
   [combat](../archive/wiki/tactical/combat.md)
2. Prone/supine [controls](../archive/wiki/client/controls.md), can be knocked
   down and get back up
3. Can pick up and fight with different types of melee weapons
4. Ranged combat (server authoritative, no rollback)
5. Advanced movement (climbing, sliding on sloped surfaces, navigating hazardous
   terrain like fording a river)
6. [Stats](../archive/wiki/shared/stats.md) system (attributes, skills, track
   damage to different body parts)
7. [Slot](../archive/wiki/client/slots.md) system
8. Empty world from 1500s geological data
9. Populate world with settlements extrapolated from population data
   (settlements are just a coordinate, name, and population level for now)
10. Generic humanoid enemy types like orcs, goblins, and bandits
11. [Travel](../archive/wiki/strategic/travel.md) system with random hostile
    encounters
12. Randomly generated [quests](../archive/wiki/strategic/quests.md) (see:
    Battle Brothers for good templates)
13. Rest system for [health](../archive/wiki/shared/health.md) recovery
14. Inventory management (loot/buy/sell items)
15. Food/water/sleep system
	1. Food and water strategic needs and automatic travel provisioning are
    implemented; sleep remains.
# Polished Product
With these features, the game becomes something that we can imagine players
actually wanting to pay for. A fun, unique product rather than a mere tech demo.

1. [Procedural modeling plugin](../archive/wiki/client/models.md)
2. In-game editor for procedural models - design your own clothes or equipment
3. Urban levels (houses, castles, etc and quests that involve them like thievery
   or assassination)
4. Improved [stealth](../archive/wiki/tactical/stealth.md) detection AI
   (investigate noises, raise alarms, patrol routes?)
5. Level editor - design your own house
6. PVP
7. More humanoid enemy types: beastmen, undead, ogres, and trolls
8. Non-humanoid enemy types like wolves or giant spiders
9. More detailed [downtime](../archive/wiki/strategic/time.md) (pick a job to
   earn a wage at)
10. Elves and the immortal [character](../archive/wiki/strategic/character.md)
    system
	1. Also need to make settlements and assets for them
	2. Character creator
# Simulation
Not required for the basic gameplay loop or polish, but increase the
verisimilitude of the world and create opportunities for emergent storytelling.

1. Settlement prosperity that is based on population and reduced by unsolved
   quests (see: Battle Brothers)
	1. Prosperity affects what items can be bought and how expensive services are
2. Disease system
3. Marry other characters and have children (Mount and Blade II: Bannerlord has
   a barebones implementation of this)
4. Celebrations like holidays and birthdays - invite friends to hang out at your
   house
	1. Werewolf/Mafia/SS13/Among Us-style quests where your job is to infiltrate
    and do something nefarious at a rival's celebration
# Not in roadmap but could be
These are all neat but aren't required for the game to feel complete. However,
if someone on the team is very passionate about one of them then we can
prioritize it.

1. [Magic](../archive/wiki/shared/magic.md) system, implement on a per-element
   basis in order of whatever is easiest
	1. Wind magic is probably the easiest, just force fields in Avian that also
    cause unbalance. Will look much cooler with dust/leaf particles.
	2. Light seems fairly easy, as long as its just for illumination and some kind
    of blinding effect
	3. Shadow would be invisibility, especially in darkness
	4. A simple version of earth can be just causing tremors that stagger enemies
    (as opposed to something more complicated like fissures)
	5. Fire requires its own system for fire spreading and temperature
	6. Frost would use the opposite side of the same temperature system
	7. Nature to summon the assistance of wild animals in combat sounds easy, but
    not anything involving plants
	8. Lightning seems very complicated to do well (Circuits? Nope.)
	9. Water seems nightmarishly complicated to do well (Fluid simulation? Fuck
    no.)
2. Become a vampire/necromancer/lich
	1. Changes the way a lot of systems for your character work, like food, water,
    sleep, exhaustion, and health
	2. Become biologically immortal, but still permanently killable unlike an Elf
	3. Don't need the game to give you quests, every night of feeding/graverobbing
    is essentially a self-driven quest
	4. Game generates PVP quests for other players to destroy you as your infamy
    increases
3. Player-run factions
	1. Basically a faction board/groupchat + shared asset ownership with quests to
    antagonize rival factions
4. Factions can manage a settlement as the mayor/governor/etc
	1. Would be like being moderators on a forum, plausibly a semi-democratic
    election for settlements in Northern Italy. Players in other settlements
    would need to depose bad mayors by force or get invaded
5. Cultists and demons
	1. See: Space Station 13
	2. Due to the bulletin board social nature of the game, this seems like it
    might be a significant source of memes.
	3. Probably the best "outlet" for players with... "indecent" inclinations...
		1. If we let players customize characters and their outfits, they are *going*
     to make ridiculous coomer characters. Moderating this will be an uphill
     battle.
		2. We can just own it and tell them do whatever they like within their secret
     cults, and if they expose their degeneracy to anyone else who reports them
     then the player-run witch hunter/holy paladin faction will be given quests
     and empowered to come and purge them unannounced during their sex parties
6. Dwarven settlements and assets
	1. Option of using the underway to travel in addition to the overworld and sea.
    Much faster through difficult terrain, but also much more dangerous
7. Mounts and mounted combat
	1. Basically when you are charging and are holding the attack button, it can be
    automatically made against any enemy that comes within reach
	2. Horse can trample over smaller enemies
	3. Very high morale effect causes most weaker enemies to route instead of hold
    their ground
8. Huge monsters that require a more detailed combat system
	1. Dragon, cyclops, giant, griffin, cockatrice, chimera, etc
	2. Dragon's Dogma does a great job of this... but it looks insanely hard to
    implement well
		1. You can climb onto enemies to attack weak points
		2. Detailed hitboxes for all the different body parts
		3. Lots of variety in the attack animations
	3. Total Warhammer does a workable job of this that looks much easier to
    implement
		1. They're fast, very tanky, and have sweeping attacks, but their size makes
     them vulnerable
		2. Poke them with polearms while ranged units shoot overhead
		3. Alternatively, anti-large hero characters are good at dueling them due to
     being able to reliably dodge their big, telegraphed attacks
		4. Flying units just magically float, their animations give the illusion of
     more detailed physics
		5. When their huge attacks send characters flying, they aren't real full-body
     colliders and ragdoll physics, everyone is still a capsule and the
     animations give the illusion of detailed physics.
9. Poisons, potions, alchemy, herbalism, and gardening
	1. "We want the Stardew Valley audience"
10. Settlements outside of Italy
	1. Assets between European countries are easy to share, need some kind of set
    of language skills that give you severe trade penalties when no one in your
    party speaks the local language
		1. Can retroactively apply this to communication with Elves/Dwarves
	2. Arabia, Africa, the East, and the New World need lots of unique assets,
    don't bother until Europe is very fleshed out (maybe modders will do this?)
