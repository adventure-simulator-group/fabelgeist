# Trade

Bookstores reuse ordinary merchant purchase authority. Buying supplies portable
inventory access; characters may instead read useful bookstore titles free
while in that city. Explicit title settlement allowlists constrain culturally
rare catalogs.

Local-problem pressure uses the same checked basis-point adjustment after base
and language pricing for displayed quotes and reducer transfers, including food.

The compiler supplies each imported settlement with canonical local production
outputs and a marginal, local, or regional scale. Future trade simulation may
consume these signals, but rules v6 does not create prices, inventory, or
shipping flows.

For the current strategic prototype, each available storefront exposes an
unlimited catalogue selected from the settlement's economy profile. Items have a
base coin value; merchant buy and sell prices are derived from it with shared
hidden profit-margin and sales-tax multipliers. Both the merchant and player
inventory tables display each item's per-unit weight and relevant coin value.
Coin is authoritative inventory rather than a separate character resource. Every
settlement reproducibly selects one denomination from a fixed 1544-flavoured
set: Rhenish gulden, Lübeck mark, Hamburg mark, Saxon thaler, Brandenburg
groschen, and Danish mark. Starter funds and newly issued payments use the
issuing settlement's denomination; quest and battle rewards use the quest's
issuing settlement. All denominations currently have equal value and are
accepted everywhere.

Inventory presents every character or party's currency as one ordinary,
collapsed **Coin** row. Its quantity, value, and weight aggregate the underlying
stacks. An accessible disclosure reveals read-only denomination rows; expansion
is transient and has no effect on sorting, filtering, or bulk actions.

The General Market, Weaponsmith, Armourer, Tailor, and Inn use the same live
trade interface and transaction reducer. The specialist storefronts filter their
unlimited displayed stock by item category, while all use the same pricing and
buy/sell behavior. Drafting a trade immediately displays the item and coin
quantity changes on both sides; inventory changes only persist after choosing
**Offer**.
Each offer is bound to its exact storefront and unique persistent service
provider. The reducer revalidates the settlement economy, provider service,
provider location and schedule, and every purchased catalogue item before
pricing or mutating inventory. Inn cooking supplies therefore remain Inn stock
rather than being reclassified as General Market goods. Trades are also bound
to the settlement where the character is currently located; visiting another
settlement's URL does not allow remote trading.
Party-scoped purchases spend pooled coin first, then the active character's
personal coin for any shortfall. The Party tab's collapsed Coin row therefore
shows both sources while drafting a purchase. Personal coin contributed to a
party purchase grants that buyer an equal amount of additional party stake;
spending already-pooled coin does not create new stake.

Multi-page workflows may pass a local absolute-path URL in `return_to`. A
successful merchant offer returns to that exact path, query, and fragment;
external and malformed destinations are rejected. Travel provisioning uses the
query to preserve the selected destination and target surplus while visiting
the market.

Herbalists use a narrower authoritative purchase path. They offer unlimited
ingredients plus all eight pre-prepared medication courses, but prepared
medication remains rejected by the generic merchant reducer. Each course costs
more than the normal merchant cost of its recipe ingredients, using shared
pricing helpers on both the server and storefront. Mixed and multiple purchases
are allowed; every medication course enters personal inventory as its own
quantity-one row. The herbalist page deliberately omits party-inventory buying
and explains that restriction so courses cannot become unusable shared stacks.

Weaponsmith and Armourer storefronts also accept individual equipment instances
for repair through separate actions that never enter the sale draft. A smith
repairs only condition bins at or below their independently seeded skill
(minimum 3), but may accept an item with additional harder damage and leave that
residual condition untouched. Custody and the quoted ETA persist across travel
and have no collection deadline. The smith quotes the full job when accepting
it: the item's base value multiplied by the share of damage that smith can
repair, rounded up to at least one coin. The quote is stable while the item is
in custody and is paid from personal coin when completed work is retrieved. The
custody table shows durability, ETA, and this full-job cost. A row arrow
retrieves that exact quoted order by default; Shift changes it to retrieve up to
two matching ready orders, and Control changes it to retrieve all matching ready
orders. The header arrow defaults to two and Control changes it to all ready
work in that shop. Bulk retrieval stops before the first order the character
cannot afford rather than failing already-affordable retrievals. Removing a
staged purchase before offering it simply cancels that purchase; it does not
create a sale or apply a merchant fee. The confirmation popup appears in the
center of the view only while an exchange is pending and includes **Offer** and
**Cancel** controls; Cancel discards the entire draft. Loot, discard, character
trade, merchant trade, and party-inventory transfers all use this same centered
confirmation pattern.

Every inventory action exposes one inward-pointing arrow control. Row controls
default to one arrow, become two while Shift is held, and become three while
Control is held. Header controls default to two arrows and become three while
Control is held. These modifiers apply consistently to merchant, character,
party, loot, discard, and smith-custody inventory views.

Equipped inventory stacks remain separate from unequipped stacks. Merchant
purchases are always added to an unequipped stack (or a new stack), and the UI
does not offer transfer or sale controls for an equipped stack.

The backpack action beneath the active character portrait opens the inventory
discard view. Discarding follows the same draft-first interaction as trading:
the player stages quantities into the left-side **Discard** list, may cancel the
draft, and must press **Discard** before the server removes anything. Equipped
items are never eligible for deletion.

The best shared Oral-language coefficient is authoritative for merchant quotes.
Lower mutual proficiency raises purchase prices and lowers sale proceeds; the
web quote and reducer use the same core rounding helpers. Prepared medicines
remain on their existing specialized purchase path.
