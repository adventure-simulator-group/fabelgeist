# Services

Generated outbreak patients are real temporary characters in the affected
settlement, but private disease/source authority is not a public settlement
fact. Before discovery, the settlement exposes only the bounded sick-local
symptom; rumor discovery then creates the observer-owned investigation. See
[Outbreak investigations](outbreaks.md).

City- and Capital-scale settlements infer a Bookstore service and Books stock.
The bookseller uses ordinary merchant purchase authority and also supplies the
free on-site fallback catalog for Reading. Book-capability items are excluded
from General Goods stock.

At strategic locations, characters raise the Herbalism Stage Modal from their
skill rail. Herbalist storefronts remain sources and exchange counterparties
for medicinal ingredients and finished remedies.

Unresolved local problems can impose capped trade and disease consequences. The
inn is the discovery funnel; a settlement without an available inn uses
overview.

## People and locations

Every seeded or imported settlement has persistent local people in addition to
its service providers. Each is a full `Character` identified by the same
authoritative `u64` character ID used by parties, relationships, morale,
estate, and personal time. `SettlementResidentProfile` adds only local
appearance, vocation, service, and dialogue metadata under that ID; it is not a
second NPC identity. The overview/public area and service locations contain
multiple people; towns and larger settlements also populate a keep. A
horizontal, keyboard- navigable circular portrait strip selects whom the active
character addresses. It is attached just above the resizable chat panel,
opposite the party portrait strip, and moves with the chat's top edge. The
selected NPC's description is centered in the remaining stage between the two
strips. Service pages initially select the service provider, while other
locations select a deterministic local. Selecting someone else keeps the party
in place and updates the visible physical description and greeting. Dialogue
subjects appear as highlighted phrases in what NPCs actually say rather than in
a separate topic list. Names are not globally or settlement-locally unique. When
one NPC refers the player to a different local who has the same displayed name,
the dialogue explicitly says that it means "the other" person and repeats the
contact's profession, appearance, and usual location. When the speaker is the
contact, they identify themselves in the first person and make their testimony
subject clickable in that line.

The book button immediately to the right of the settlement identity and official
time toggles the character's journal without leaving the current location.
Journal mode replaces the settlement's left rail with a recency-sorted quest
list and its right rail with the selected quest's dry log; toggling it again or
pressing Escape restores the location rails.

Public squares, residential areas, and, for towns and larger settlements, the
keep appear as selectable building tabs alongside services in the settlement
header. Standalone organization chapters choose an existing facade by authored
building kind and use their stable heraldic charge, while public places retain
their house/castle vocabulary. These places use the same authoritative portrait,
description, and chat surface; villages and hamlets cannot enter a keep that
their population does not have.

Resident presences and daily time windows are keyed by that character ID and are
strategic database state, not tactical positions or tick state. The player view
exposes physical presentation, occupation, household, observable presentation,
and public local role, but never private sex, personality, motives, beliefs,
quest truth, generation weights, required causal bridges, or the private
explanation for an unusual presence. Generation uses one stable typed weighted
evaluator for production and tests; zero weights are impossible, while any rare
choice marked as bridge-dependent is rejected unless the settlement context
supplies that bridge.

Settlements may have public disease outbreak facts: disease, start and end
character-minute bounds, and intensity. Acquisition uses deterministic
continuous overlap plus innate and acquired immunity, so dividing the same stay
into smaller rest actions does not reroll exposure.
Imported settlements carry a bounded strategic industry profile derived from
land use, hydrology, soil, geology, historical woodland, population, and route
accessibility. It describes plausible production rather than stock on hand;
accessibility can reduce scale but cannot invent resources.

The map camera follows the rendered map element's measured aspect ratio and
observes later layout changes. Tile selection therefore covers the world area
actually visible in desktop, narrow, and resized layouts without distorting or
letterboxing the map.

Raster terrain uses a visible light-brown area for open hills, green for
forest, and dark green for their overlap. It does not add symbolic hill or
mountain stamps to the paper map.

Settlement and quest destinations share the same strategic **location** shell. A
settlement's base location view shows population statistics and historical
alternative names on the left and a short population-based description on the
right. Imported settlements may also expose a plain-text Viabundus
settlement/city description in a collapsed section labeled with its source
language. Its Map tab contains an accessible SVG interaction layer over detailed
Paper AVIF world tiles with roads, water, generalized GLO-30 height bands and
contours, and explicitly partial Copernicus forest coverage. The browser loads
only cached tiles covering the current pan and zoom; current and selected
settlements, locally issued available quests, the party's active quest at its
issuing settlement, connectivity, settlement names, links, and the straight line
from the current location to the selected destination stay in the dynamic inline
SVG overlay. This keeps each response bounded rather than exposing every quest
in the world. Settlements use population-class village, town, and city
pictograms, while quests use diamond markers. Labels retain a consistent screen
size, appear progressively by settlement importance and zoom, and avoid one
another in screen space. Every canonical settlement or visible geographic quest
symbol can be inspected through the same `?destination=` URL used by the
ordinary destination list. Selecting a destination initially fits the map to the
corridor between it and the party's current location, with a close local view
when both locations coincide; map symbols retain a consistent on-screen size
throughout zooming, and the closest view is backed by a high-quality level-6
tile set. A directly connected settlement or active quest destination shows
distance, journey time, and the existing travel action; any other settlement or
available quest shows useful detail without a travel form. Dragging pans, the
mouse wheel or a two-finger pinch zooms, and keyboard arrows, `+`,
`-`, and `Home` provide accessible navigation without adding map
controls, a legend, or source information to the screen. Links and
server-rendered selection remain usable without JavaScript. Settlement services
remain separate tabs and are available only at settlement locations.

Geographic map pins and settlement travel actions require an imported
`source_node_id` on the current settlement. Demo or otherwise source-less
settlements show an explicit map-data-not-initialized state, and source-less
destinations are omitted from the geographic SVG rather than interpreting
their nongeographic coordinates as longitude and latitude.

The backend classifies every materialized settlement by population as Hamlet
(under 2,000), Village (2,000-3,999), Town (4,000-7,999), City (8,000-12,999),
or Capital (13,000 and above), with population level as the fallback when no
estimate exists. These regional bands ensure the imported 1544 playable area
represents all five settlement scales. The strategic map progressively hides
lower-level settlement pins as the camera zooms out while always retaining the
current and selected settlements. Each service tab layers its existing service
SVG over a grayscale, CSS-tinted building background. Unknown settlements,
hamlets, and villages use the village set; towns use town overrides when
present; and cities or capitals use city overrides when present. A missing
higher-tier image falls back to that service's village building. The location
header is twice the height of compact application headers so the low silhouettes
and large service marks remain legible. The tabs meet the lower edge of the sky
and the active building is shown by an underline. The settlement name and saved
character time share one carved or engraved rectangular sign island. The active
tint carries through both interface rails, whose recessed interiors, edge beams,
square corner blocks, and darker interactive rows are all derived from that
tint, as well as through character inspection via the validated `building` URL
parameter. Quest destinations use green environmental framing. The location
header renders a continuously interpolated sky from the active character's saved
time snapshot: daylight is bright blue, dawn and dusk are warm, and nighttime
plus the building surfaces are darker still. The sun or moon follows an
edge-to-edge arc that peaks over the center at noon or midnight, while other
header text uses protected dark labels for reliable contrast.

Weaponsmith chimneys add a subtle decorative SVG smoke layer without changing
the raster building or service semantics. Quest destinations use two physical
tabs: the default Map view shares the unlit tent scene used by travel camps,
while the Enemy view places a skull mark over the encounter ground. The Enemy
view presents combat before resolution and recovered loot afterward, so loot is
not a separate tab. All effect and prop layers are noninteractive.

The wilderness props follow the ornament anatomy at
`styles/timber-framed/ornament/<variant>/ornament.png`. Each uses a 512-by-512
transparent canvas, a bottom-center anchor on source row 487, and the shared
top-bar scene scale range of 0.8473–1. The raster may overlap only the standard
service-tab art bleed (0.65 rem inline, 0.45 rem above, and 0.5 rem below);
animated effects may rise through its transparent upper field. These
front-facing compositions must not be mirrored.

Camp and quest-location headers also carry a distant grayscale wilderness
horizon behind their tabs. Forest, grassland, and hills variants use the same
2880-by-240 transparent panorama contract as settlement horizons and inherit
the live sky tint and brightness. Until imported terrain selects the actual
biome, a deterministic hash of the camp party or quest-location ID keeps the
assigned scenery stable between visits without adding persisted state.

Each settlement offers a number of services as tabs of a unified trade page.
Each service corresponds to a profession and has a default operator NPC. A
greeting links the NPC's profession; when a matching local organization
representative shares the building, asking about the work names that
representative and directs prospective apprentices to them. Without a matching
representative, the operator preserves the lightweight direct apprenticeship
fallback. The left side lists what the NPC offers, including training or other
services where appropriate, and the right side lists what the party offers.

The general merchant teaches Command; cooks at inns teach Cooking; weaponsmiths
and armourers teach Smithing; and tailors teach Tailoring. Medical crafts use
three distinct organizations: the informal, fee-free Fellowship of Herbalists
teaches Herbalism, the College of Physicians teaches Physiology for patient
assessment, fallible differentials, and non-operative treatment, and the
Surgeons' Guild teaches Surgery for operations. Their ranks and practice rewards
are independent. The church teaches its own religious tradition through prayer
and practice activities. Inns also sell cooking implements and food ingredients.
Most apprentices pay for instruction; fellowship learners do not. At rank 2 in
an associated profession skill they may practice independently for a small wage,
and at rank 4 they may reach a senior rank whose practice earns a good income.
Religious progression uses novice, cleric, and teacher as neutral interface
terms, and visible religious practice earns local Fame rather than money.

This remains a lightweight profession and organization system rather than a
simulation of guild politics. Membership, rank, and any authored dues use the
shared organization records. Rivalries, membership limits, exclusive
apprenticeships, and territorial restrictions are not modeled. Sharing one skill
across curricula does not confer membership or rank in another organization.

The location header reflects settlement scale through architecture and its
distant horizon. Unknown settlements, hamlets, and villages use the low village
set; towns use moderately prosperous two- and three-story guildhouses; cities
and capitals use taller masonry civic and merchant buildings. Each tier has
inland, Baltic coastal, and river horizons. Until the world import supplies
hydrology, a deterministic hash of the settlement ID assigns one of those three
variants, so the view is stable between visits without creating persistent
geographic data. The imported selector is intended to replace that temporary
hash directly.

Across each architectural tier, churches and watchtowers rise above ordinary
service buildings while retaining the shared ground line. Every facade keeps a
common central light wall field for the separately layered white service mark;
the mark stays at one height across the tier. Tall facades generally place their
entrance beneath that field, with centered doors favored for churches and
watchtowers and used selectively for other city buildings.

Horizon art preserves its aspect ratio and stays centered on the bottom edge.
Ordinary wider screens crop its sides instead of stretching fields, buildings,
bridges, ships, or towers; ultrawide-specific composition is deferred.

Services show up at the top, above the list of items in their own list. Each
service has a button to expand it, which shows a custom per-service form. To
rest at an inn, for example, there is a slider for how many nights you would
like to pay for. Doctors may have a healing menu for different treatments
(bandaging, physiology for diseases, surgery). Smiths may have a menu where you
can search for a custom piece of equipment designed by another player which you
can pay them to produce. Mount & Blade Bannerlord has a good reference for this
menu, including the ability to trade intangibles (the barter menu with other
lords kind of has this).

Weaponsmith and Armourer trade rows also offer **Repair**, plus a **Repair all**
action. An action is disabled only when the item is undamaged or every damaged
condition bin exceeds that smith's skill; mixed damage is accepted and repaired
as far as the smith can manage. Submitted items leave the owner's inventory and
appear in a bottom-anchored custody panel below the independently scrolling
wares list. The panel grows only as needed up to half the list height and then
scrolls internally. It shows the ETA and the residual condition the smith cannot
repair. Finished items can be retrieved after leaving and returning to the
settlement, with no expiry.
> Halbe: Brothels may provide... _other_ services... for a morale bonus. ||But
> also a risk of being afflicted by a disease||.

In the center of the screen, clients may render a 3D window of the NPC
representing the service. They can have dialogue that plays, like a greeting
when you open their menu, a goodbye when you leave it, and comments as you
interact with their menu. But this should never interfere with the gameplay. You
don't have to click through dialogue in order to buy something, it just plays in
the background as you use their service. This is not important for the MVP, and
later down the line this would also be a great opportunity to add voice acting
and mocap to give the world some personality.

The shared chat panel floats just above the bottom of the center view with a
translucent, fixed environmental background and can be resized vertically from
its top edge. Its height is shared across settlement and quest-location pages
and remembered by the client. Local, Party, Settlement, direct-message, Guild,
and Info messages share one chronological stream rather than separate tabs.
Messages are distinguished by color without a repeated channel-name prefix. A
compact row of colored square toggles filters each channel: Local is white,
Party blue, Settlement yellow, direct messages purple, Guild green, and Info
grey. The channel name is available as the toggle's hover tooltip and accessible
label rather than persistent text. Enabled channels show their full color, while
disabled channels become translucent; there is no inner enablement mark. Info is
reserved for game notices such as inventory and currency changes.
> Halbe: The inspiration for this is the Maiden in Black from Demon's Souls, who
> recites an incantation while you are in the level-up menu.

# Social
Each settlement has at least an inn, which serves as a social hub for chatting
with other players and forming parties. Quests originate from the NPCs who run
settlement services rather than from a separate notice board. A service tab uses
a gold exclamation when its NPC has an available quest and red when the active
completed quest is ready to report, and the quest is offered through linked
lines in the shared party chat. Map destination lists mark settlements with
available quests in gold and the party's active quest route in red; the current
settlement is included as a non-traveling row, and completing the active
objective leaves its marker red until turn-in. Parties are independent of
quests, and every character is always in one: a new or departing character leads
a party of one.

The crown on a portrait identifies the party leader, which is always the
leftmost member. Current aggregate Physiology, Command, and Religion checks are
stacked vertically as the leftmost element of the floating party strip,
immediately before the party-inventory chest. Surgical capability is never
aggregated: recruitment and each operative procedure use the character's direct
Surgery check, so backup practitioners matter when the primary practitioner is
wounded or several patients need simultaneous triage. The role-add button sits
immediately to the right of the rightmost filled party member and opens the
centered recruitment popup. The popup separates current roles, saved templates,
role details, individual recommendation groups, and its final action into
distinct sections. A leader creates a named **Role** with individual minimum
recommendations and a quantity; each position created by that quantity is a
visually grouped **Slot**. Current roles can be reopened in the same builder to
change their name, recommendations, or total slot count. Slot count cannot fall
below the number already filled. Deleting a role clears its pending applications
and role association without removing party members who filled it. Saved role
specifications live in a toolbar at the top of the popup. They can be loaded by
selecting them, renamed or deleted through hover actions, or created immediately
from the current recommendations through a separate naming prompt. Saving a
template is independent of adding an active recruitment role. The Combat group
contains adjacent melee, ranged, and heavy checkboxes plus weapon precision and
armor tier sliders; the Mobility group contains Athletics and Endurance sliders.
They are recommendations rather than hard gates, so applicants and applications
that fall short receive a warning but remain actionable.

Applicant inspection uses the same icon-based character summary as a full
character sheet. Its equipped-hand profile is loaded from the applicant's
actual equipment, so dual-wielded duplicates collapse and hybrid weapons expose
all of their weapon leaves. This presentation does not alter recruitment
recommendation matching or capability checks.

Party authority is collaborative without becoming ambiguous: the leader executes
party-level actions directly, while any other living member may attempt the same
controls to send a persistent suggestion. The leader receives Approve/Deny
notices beneath that member's portrait. Suggestions cover travel, quest
acceptance/abandonment, tactical combat and autoresolve, recruitment roles and
applications, member removal, party skill targets, shared inventory targets,
mission cancellation, and disbanding. Turning in a completed quest is the
exception: any living party member at the quest giver's settlement may report
its completion and immediately claim the reward for the party. A member's newest
travel suggestion replaces their older destination, and their shared-inventory
edits coalesce into one notification. NPC leaders approve suggestions
automatically after two seconds.

Leadership uses standing votes. At any time, a living member may use the crown
control above any living member's portrait, including their own, to assign or
reassign their one vote. The selected crown remains visible; a vote for the
current leader is shown as a non-interactive gold crown. New solo parties
receive a self-vote, and every living member joining through a party merge
automatically votes for the destination's current leader. Votes survive
leadership changes. A living leader is replaced only when a challenger has at
least 66% of living members' votes. If the current leader is dead, the inclusive
threshold is 50%; when only one member survives, normalization supplies that
survivor's self-ballot so succession cannot deadlock. Dead or departed voters
and invalid candidates are removed. When multiple candidates qualify, the
greatest tally wins, then the lowest character ID. Re-evaluation occurs after
votes, membership changes, and death, without requiring a newly elected leader
to immediately retain 66%.

The leader separately configures party-level targets for Physiology, Command,
and Religion from the aggregate bars above the party portraits. Each notched bar
shows the current aggregate as its fill and its whole-number target from 0–5 as
a movable marker; clicking anywhere on the bar moves the marker to the nearest
notch, and the marker may also be dragged. Hovering reveals the aggregate to one
decimal place and its target. Physiology uses the bounded geometric-support
equation described in [Stats](../shared/stats.md): member values are sorted
highest-first, then receive weights of one, one half, one quarter, and so on
before being combined against the unfilled portion of the five-point scale.
Religion uses each character's maximum effective tradition check as a UI-only
coverage summary, while Command uses the strongest speaker, a saturating
coordination allowance, and supporting members' deviations from a 2.5 baseline.
These checks never filter an individual role. The same bars preview a
prospective member from either side of recruitment: green shows an increase and
red shows a Command decrease caused by a below-baseline recruit. Checks
receiving no contribution are omitted from a projection. Candidate cards
otherwise retain only their capability summary rather than repeating exact
statistics.

A character applies to the role as a whole rather than an individual slot. Open
slots in the same role appear as overlapping portraits, without a connector;
filled positions become ordinary party-member portraits and lose their role
presentation. Hovering an open slot reveals its recommended tags and applicant
names. Selecting it replaces the sidebars with exact role requirements on the
left and detailed applicant capability values plus Accept/Reject controls on the
right. Every applicant in that right rail has a selectable portrait; selecting
it shows the applicant's stats on the left and their placeholder portrait in the
center without replacing the request list. Other applications stay pending while
the role has capacity and are rejected only when its last slot fills.
Notification badges live on the corresponding open-slot stack, while the browser
window title retains the total pending count. Local development creates two
randomly named bot applicants per slot: one that meets the recommendations and
one that deliberately misses a requirement.

The default chat channel is **Local**. NPC conversations belong to the active
party and service NPC; player conversations belong to both complete parties, so
party members share the same history even if they open the subject later. Player
conversations require both parties to occupy the same strategic location.
Selecting any local player opens their stats, bio, party information, and the
shared conversation; a stranger may submit a general application, while an
existing member sees the relevant leave or remove control. General applications
share a zero-capacity, requirement-free **Unassigned** role. Zero capacity stops
a role from being advertised but does not discard its pending applications.
Incoming players who speak to the party appear as selectable portrait shortcuts
at the lower-right of the center view. Quest-giver recruitment is advertised
only while the recruiting party remains in that settlement; if every role has
zero open slots, the NPC mentions the helping party without inviting
applications. The leader's linked name in that dialogue selects their local
character profile and conversation.

Clicking any filled character portrait selects that character. The character
sheet shows its automatic icon summary before biography and skills, while the
opposite rail shows attributes and health. Neutral personality axes are
omitted, and each shown personality tag has a tooltip stating its exact morale
multiplier and any event-duration multiplier. On one's own biography, hovering
or focusing the Religion entry reveals a **Renounce** action when the character
currently professes a faith. Summary ranks deliberately use healthy
aptitude-capped values: current injuries do not alter recruitment or character
summary icons. The summary's tooltip still exposes the exact healthy rank, and
the full skill rail separately shows injury-adjusted current performance.
Recruitment recommendation matching continues to use the existing capability
projection; the icon summary is presentation only.

Party portraits retain their normal social surface. Selecting a present
settlement NPC instead opens that person's dialogue; icon topics in the
transcript reveal spoken responses for ordinary conversation and, when legal,
courtship or wedding proposals. Qualitative morale, affinity, and familiarity
appear as icon meters beside the selected person. Quest-specific confrontation
approaches appear only while the corresponding quest dialogue is active. The
fallible Insight impression happens passively when the witness's quest
testimony is heard.

A living active character with Physiology 2 or better sees the selected
character's Physiology surface as a passive, durable notebook derived from
actual shared-presence spans. It shows quantized Humour readings, recognizable
symptoms, known interventions, localization appropriate to historical skill,
and explicit gaps, but never diagnoses or recommends. Cooking remains an
informational skill row; actual cooking begins from the Fireplace counterparty
shown at settlement buildings and journey camps.

Herbalists sell concrete prepared interventions into personal inventory.
The active character self-administers a preparation from personal inventory by
checking its inventory checkbox. This consumes the concrete item as one
standard course; the trusted server supplies the current profile version,
intrinsic route, 1,000-milliunit amount, and whole-body scope. Active courses
appear as compact current-medication status with a Stop action until stopped or
naturally expired. The generic reducer continues to authorize an eligible,
co-located party member administering a patient's own preparation, but the
inventory checkbox intentionally remains self-administration only.
Physiology does not craft preparations; Herbalism #214 owns
ingredients, lots, composition, recipes, and crafting, while Chemistry #215
owns chemical behavior. Foraging remains deferred.

Every settlement currently has one church with a fixed faith. Its priest offers
conversion only to that faith through the dialogue system; changing the
settlement's stored religion changes the priest's topic, profession, and the
faith-specific church icon in the settlement navigation. Multiple churches in
one large city are deferred until the settlement service model supports distinct
church instances.

Hovering near a non-leader portrait reveals a removal action beside its
inventory action. The leader may remove another member, while a non-leader sees
the action only on their own portrait and may use it to leave. A
player-controlled character must settle any party-inventory stake before
removal; dismissing a generated companion automatically withdraws its liquid
gold stake through the normal party-inventory system before it leaves. The
leader disbands the party instead of removing themselves. Generated companions
automatically use the normal settlement-rest system until their injuries heal
whenever the party reaches a settlement; their personal strategic clocks advance
independently.

Personal and shared inventories retain a desired quantity per item. Personal
targets belong to the character; shared targets belong to the character who
leads the party, so their preferences return whenever they lead a later party. A
positive target keeps an empty row visible for restocking. Merchant trading
exposes Player and Party tabs on the player's rail and uses the selected
inventory and its gold.

Merchant, party-member, party-chest, and loot panels share staged transfer
controls. One chevron stages one item, two stage only the quantity needed to
reach or preserve the destination target, and three stage everything movable.
Footer controls apply the same action to every row from top to bottom. Equipped
items are excluded until unequipped.

Moving near a filled portrait reveals its backpack action. A party member's
backpack opens the two-character item offer view. The active character's
backpack opens a discard view: items are first staged into a left-side
**Discard** list, can be removed from the draft, and are deleted only after
confirming **Discard**. Equipped items cannot be staged.

Armor is summarized from the equipped pieces covering each body region, not item
names or an average armor score. **1/4 armor** means either a shield or a helmet
worn with a cuirass; **1/2 armor** requires a helmet and cuirass plus either
tasset/leg protection or a shield; **3/4 armor** adds both arms and thigh/knee
protection; **full armor** requires high coverage on every modeled region. This
follows the broad historical silhouettes: a pikeman's half armor consisted of
helmet, cuirass, gorget, and tassets
([Art Institute of Chicago](https://archive.artic.edu/arms-and-armor/artwork/106286)),
while cuirassier three-quarter armor ended around the knee and omitted lower-leg
defenses
([Metropolitan Museum of Art](https://resources.metmuseum.org/resources/metpublications/pdf/Recent_Acquisitions_A_Selection_2001_2002_The_Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art_Bulletin_v_60_no_2_Fall_2002.pdf)).
The current body model has one slot per arm and leg, so high regional coverage
is temporarily used to distinguish full harness from three-quarter armor until
upper/lower limb slots exist.

All of this is done in hypertext, but what's ostensibly physically going on in
the world is that NPCs explain their own problems and rumors spread once a party
takes the work: "a couple of adventurers are planning on slaying those goblins
that have been ambushing the merchant caravans, I hear they're looking for an
archer. You should seek them out at Grub's Tavern if you're interested". When
you show up in their group chat, you're approaching them at their table.

## Off-Topic
Not all socialization in settlements is relevant to quests. The tavern is also
effectively a public chatroom. Later, after the MVP, we can also give players
the ability to purchase a building and make factions which may serve as
faction-exclusive chatrooms.

> between Elves, Dwarves, and Humans would be very appropriate. Even the kind of
> discrimination that would be considered objectionable in the modern day would
> be fine, like sexism or intra-human racism, due to the system described in the
> next section

## Moderation
We don't _want_ to be the speech police, but there is inevitably going to be
spam or links to pornography and other objectionable content that we will have
to deal with. However, it would be great if we could give players the tools to
enforce speech themselves and opt-in to more strict moderation than the bare
minimum needed to stop spam and illegal content. Essentially, a player-run
faction could own a place like a tavern and would be responsible for handling
the moderation. There can be multiple taverns in a settlement, so if one of them
has an overzealous moderator then you could simply go to one of the other ones.
If they are _all_ overzealous, especially if its that a particularly obstinate
group of players are trying to establish a monopoly to enforce their annoying
speech rules, then we can leverage the fact that this is a _game_ not just a
forum. Steal their stuff, assassinate their characters, burn their building
down. Normally, these things would be hard to get away with. But players might
have the ability to rate the moderators, and if enough people complain then we
can increase the likelihood of success when attempting these "faction warfare"
actions (when you do not have the will of the people, player establishments are
protected by [favor](../shared/magic.md).

None of these player-run social hub features should be in the MVP, we will just
be very selective about who we invite for testing until we add support for this
stuff.

## Languages

Each imported settlement has an inferred East-central, West-central, and Low
vernacular distribution totaling 100%. Low rises northward; longitude divides
the central dialects, with southern Thuringia favoring East-central. Yiddish is
a small per-person incidence, never a town-exclusive language. Deterministically
selected Yiddish NPCs are fluent in Yiddish and have a 0.8 best-shared-language
coefficient with a fluent local German; direct German hours account for the
Yiddish/German correlation. Demo settlements use explicit fallback profiles.
Books, libraries, and tavern/priest translators require future item and service
systems.

Each settlement also has a deterministic, versioned economy profile. Population,
prosperity, road access, and nearby production jointly decide which services
exist and which stock categories are common. A tiny settlement may expose only
an inn and general store; a village uses a general blacksmith; prosperous towns
split weaponsmith and armorer services. Generalists carry broader categories
where specialists are absent. The server enforces service availability for
trade, herbalist care, and repairs. The overview exposes prosperity,
specializations, and every religion represented by the canonical legal status,
not merely the faith selected for the single church/priest presentation.

Authored organization chapters retain stable settlement and `organization-*`
location identity metadata. Chapters linked to an available market, forge,
armoury, tailor, herbalist, inn, or church service place their deterministic
persistent representative inside that ordinary service building, alongside its
default operator and visitor, and do not add another Place Facade. If the
mapped service is unavailable the chapter safely retains its standalone
building. Physician and surgeon chapters, and organizations without a service,
remain standalone. Organization-aware dialogue stays with the representative.
Every rendered Place Facade exposes its exact building identity. Character and
party inspection links preserve that identity only while it belongs to the
current settlement's rendered set, including authored standalone organization
chapters; unavailable services, non-standalone chapters, foreign chapter IDs,
and unknown identities are discarded by both page state and redirects.
