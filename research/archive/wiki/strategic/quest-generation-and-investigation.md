# Quest generation and investigation

Generated **outbreak** cases store typed private disease, source, patient
chronology, and exact-remediation truth while exposing only ordinary sick-local
symptoms until evidence or testimony is learned. Their physical and social
routes share the generic action graph, and patients/corpses use the real disease
and autoresolve pipelines. See [Outbreak investigations](outbreaks.md).

Strategic quest autoresolve can leave opponent corpses in the counterparty
area. Those bodies derive from the ordinary combat outcome rather than authored
wound clues; see [Autopsies](autopsies.md). Generated victim incidents should
use the same bounded autoresolve seam when a producer is added.

This page is the canonical technical reference for authored quest content,
deterministic case generation, observer-specific investigation knowledge,
evidence, and discovery.

## Source-aware ambiguity

Generated testimony presentation is not a reliability oracle. Account wording
families are selected independently from hidden reliability, generated location
claims share the same route-segment grant shape, and journal confidence
describes provenance rather than sincerity. The same visible wording, source
shape, confidence band, and destination class must remain compatible with
truthful, mistaken, partial, evasive, and deceptive private states.

Hearing quest testimony automatically produces a fallible passive Insight
assessment for each authoritative proposition boundary. The observer-safe
signal may be uncertain, lean untrue, or lean true; all three can be wrong and
all three remain actionable. It never declares intent, changes a proposition,
or reveals factual accuracy. Private accuracy and demeanor are separate:
mistaken witnesses can look sincere, while evasive and partly truthful accounts
have no clean directional signal.
or grants navigation.
Every primary witness volunteers the same reliability-neutral public pattern
account. A separate private pattern detail may or may not exist, sampled
independently from reliability; its presence never changes the initial
dialogue's text, cardinality, order, or source. Atomic claim boundaries come
from private generated testimony records, never browser sentence splitting.

Persistent NPC personality and starting morale are sampled once from
server-private entropy and stored; public NPC IDs do not determine them. Named
morale-event rows preserve why morale changes. Current settled morale,
relationship affinity, familiarity, personality, and the chosen approach all
affect resolution, while browser projections remain qualitative.
Ordinary timed chat is a contextual topic in the selected resident's dialogue.
It may improve or strain morale and affinity and always builds familiarity,
but it never diagnoses pressure or releases testimony.
Claim-specific Charm, Command, and Bluff responses remain available only in
the active dialogue session where that observer heard the claim.

Field action skills are deliberately narrow. `FollowTracks` and
`ReacquireTracks` use the matching Terrain skill; other investigation actions
use observation, with ambushes combining observation and Stealth. Until mixed
terrain exists, Forest maps to Forest, Hills and Underground to Hills,
Settlement and Ruins to Urban, Plains and Road to Plains, and Marsh to
Wetlands.

Generated physical trails are immutable private manifest authority. A
`TrackTrail` owns an ordered chain of observer-scoped `TrackSegment` IDs; every
segment records its ordinal, explicit terrain, safe finding, and adjacent
predecessor/next links. Exactly one physical tracking action owns each segment.
Completing an early segment records only its safe finding and route-segment
knowledge, then activates the adjacent segment. Only the final segment may
produce an exact true-site destination. Inactive segment capabilities are not
projected, so the browser cannot infer the remaining segment count, destination,
fixed difficulty, or canonical cause. Attempt progress remains local to the
opaque segment capability.

## Developer quest editor

Settlement pages expose a complete quest-authoring dialog when the existing
browser-local developer mode is enabled. The top-right book button loads the
startup-compiled catalog, closed engine mechanics, and the current settlement's
persistent navigable NPCs. Its typed repeaters cover the template and canonical
cause, consequences and incident cadence, sites and areas, witnesses and
testimony/referrals, physical evidence and deterministic inspection topics,
routes and action outputs, DNF objectives/custody/hostiles, finales, dialogue
producers, canonical events, and causal bridges.

Submission derives the settlement from the session-selected character's
authoritative current location; the
browser never supplies a settlement ID. Structural diagnostics (references,
bounds, navigable NPCs, and generated-case invariants) always block creation.
Catalog compatibility/curation diagnostics block by default, but the explicitly
labeled developer override can suppress only that second tier. Invalid input is
transactional and writes nothing.

Debug and automatic generation call the same strategic materializer.
`DeveloperGenerationContext` persists the complete definition, compatibility
override, private observer entropy, ordinal, current witness candidates, and
catalog revision in private authority. Authority validation compiles that
context again and requires an exact manifest match.

Author-local IDs are validated before compilation, then every internal case,
site, area, event, proposition, witness, evidence, action, objective, custody
object, hostile group, finale, and bridge reference is deterministically
rewritten beneath the newly minted case scope. Persistent settlement NPC IDs
and catalog IDs are never rewritten. This permits the same definition to be
spawned repeatedly without colliding in globally keyed authority tables.
Starting custody is authored as exact object/site tuples; its asset-or-subject
kind is derived unambiguously from objective leaves rather than from the finale.

Creating a debug quest inserts only latent open world authority. It deliberately
does not grant a rumor receipt, referral, journal entry, destination pin, or any
observer knowledge. Players discover it through the same tavern/NPC rumor path
as automatically generated trouble.

The editor is complete for the declarative surfaces represented by
`GeneratedCase`. Closed engine mechanics remain Rust-owned and are exposed as
schema options. Tactical encounter execution and tactical enemy authoring are
outside this editor; hostile identity, count, and site are configurable while
the existing tactical/autoresolve systems consume them.

`SolveChallenge` is a generic case objective but is not an investigation-editor
surface yet. The editor schema does not offer it, and compilation rejects a
manually supplied `SolveChallenge` requirement with a structural diagnostic at
the exact objective requirement path. First-class authored challenges require
challenge declarations, presenter binding, and authority materialization
before this restriction can be removed.

## Authoring catalog

Modular quest and bestiary content is authored in the strict JSON-compatible
subset of YAML under `content/quests/`. Files are read in sorted path order,
validated during the `adventuresim-core` build, embedded in the executable,
and parsed into an immutable catalog once at process startup. Production does
not read loose YAML. The SHA-256 digest of filenames and exact source bytes is
the generated-case catalog revision, so changing authored content creates a
new deterministic replay boundary.

`bestiary.yaml` owns current monster names, aliases, combat values,
loot/loadout identifier, innate resistance and padding, behavior, habitats,
descriptions, clues, ambiguity links, and preparation text.
`investigation.yaml` owns evidence portraits, inspection topics and
creation-time DC ranges, witness demographics and circumstances, descriptions,
sites, and rare bridges. `generation.yaml` owns templates and separate
plausibility/curation weights, including explicit hard zeros.

Quest files may also declare `dialogue_variants`: bounded inert templates for
generated `referral` prose. Variants reuse dialogue's typed
condition tree and highest-priority selection semantics. They are presentation
only: no variant can change canonical facts, reliability, recipient, route,
or eligibility. Templates are rendered only from server-supplied values. The
quest compiler records the exact template scalar source span, so generated
referrals use the existing developer-mode edit link to the
selected quest YAML. Contract and finale exchanges remain ordinary compiled
dialogue content; use `content/dialogue/` for those surfaces.

Generated testimony does not use a parallel quest prose wrapper. Its authored
`spoken_text` and exact `challenge_text` are expanded by a generic dialogue
response's typed testimony binding into structured resolved fragments. This
preserves punctuation and duplicate surrounding text without browser
substring reconstruction. Volunteered and socially released withheld drafts
use the same emitter, and private claim authority is attached to the exact
emitted event sequence and event-local claim order before the gateway can
project an opaque challenge token.

Run `cargo run -p adventuresim-core --bin questgen-check -- validate` after an
edit. Build-time embedding, process startup, and the authoring checker use the
same exhaustive validator. It rejects unknown fields, duplicate or overlong
IDs, dangling references, incomplete relation coverage, ambiguous witness
rules, invalid closed-mechanic names, malformed evidence DCs and weights, and
unsupported template graphs. Diagnostics include the source file and
structural path. Open catalog IDs are limited to 63 ASCII identifier bytes.

### Current typed adapter boundary

Threat, site, witness-demographic, circumstance, ambiguous-description,
physical-evidence, bestiary-trace, and causal-bridge identities are bounded
open string IDs. A new value using existing mechanics therefore requires YAML
only. Closed Rust enums remain only
where the engine must execute a finite mechanic: rig topology, attack style,
protection, temperament, activity period, terrain, evidence check attribute,
reliability behavior, route/action and objective operation, settlement symptom,
and encounter archetype. Adding a new value to one of those finite mechanic
vocabularies requires Rust.
`shattering_blow` is a preparation hypothesis backed by the existing physical
resistance/padding model; it does not introduce a damage multiplier.

Typed investigation lists, aliases, regional priors and loadout IDs are
embedded. Tactical materialization currently consumes only one loot item ID;
it does not support multi-item authored loadouts, ability scripts, bespoke AI
state machines, or new rig/animation topologies. Behavior currently reaches
combat through temperament, perception, stealth, morale, movement, attack,
ranged precision, encounter scale, and physically based innate resistance and
padding. These are the factual incomplete bestiary surfaces for this change.

The first catalog boundary does not yet interpret arbitrary authored graph
programs. Reliability semantics (truthful, mistaken, evasive, deceptive),
account-style behavior, route/action execution, finale/objective execution,
symptom-to-settlement-effect calculation, and incident construction remain
closed engine mechanics. Their available IDs and primary selection weights are
declared in YAML, but adding a new executable semantic requires Rust. Likewise,
template declarations select the route/objective set, cause-to-finale mapping,
consequence profile, incident interval, and incident ceiling persisted in each
generated manifest. The two supported route/objective graph shapes still have
typed Rust assemblers, and startup rejects any other shape. This prevents
content from becoming executable server code and is the principal incomplete
quest surface of this PR.

Witness demographic selection is also authored. A match rule may constrain
the NPC facts `age_band`, `sex`, `profession`, and `local_role`; empty lists are
wildcards. Age bands are `child`, `adolescent`, `adult`, and `elder`, and sex is
`female` or `male`. Profession and local-role selectors are lowercase
identifiers matched against either the complete generated NPC fact or one
whole alphanumeric token in that fact; arbitrary substrings never match.
Selectors must match the finite NPC fact vocabulary known at startup. Higher
priority wins. Exactly one selector-free fallback is required, and
equal-priority rules belonging to different demographics may not overlap under
the same matching function used at runtime. Fallback priority is ignored: the
fallback is consulted only when no non-fallback rule matches.

Generated quests are deterministic typed case manifests assembled from shared
modules rather than scripts with substituted nouns. The initial catalog has
two families:

- `RecurringDepredation` investigates repeated attacks, locates one bound
  hostile group, and resolves it through the strategic mission outcome seam.
- `DisappearanceOrLoss` uses physical and social routes to locate the same
  person, asset, or false claim, then rescues, retrieves and returns, or
  exposes it according to the canonical cause.

The family does not determine the answer. Threat, site, witness demographic,
circumstance, report description, reliability, evidence, and route are
separate variables constrained by typed relations. Descriptions reuse the
shared bestiary and deliberately fit several threats.

## Weighted constraint model

Every candidate relation has separate positive integer plausibility and
curation weights. Authoritative selection uses bounded integer arithmetic,
stable candidate IDs, and deterministic domain-separated entropy. Zero means
impossible. Low positive weights remain possible, but sufficiently unusual
combinations must name a typed causal bridge. A selected bridge materializes a
canonical event, discoverable evidence, and a playable lead. Each bridge
authors the existing action that emits its evidence separately for both
supported template families; startup rejects missing families or action names
that their typed assembler does not emit. A selected bridge from any
generation relation is carried through to this materialization step. Evidence
relations are the one explicit exception: startup rejects bridges there
because the follow-up evidence selector has no case-graph materialization
context.

The solver uses deterministic weighted candidate order, forward rejection,
and backtracking under a hard node budget. Its private trace records factors,
hard-zero reasons, required bridges, forward rejections, accepted choices, and
backtracks. Static typed catalogs are intentional: do not add runtime closures,
floating-point authoritative draws, duplicated inverse tables, or unbounded
dynamic rules.

## Manifest invariants

`adventuresim-core::quest_generation::GeneratedCase` contains canonical and
public identities, cause and events, consequences, sites and areas, persistent
NPC witness bindings, proposition testimony, evidence, typed investigation
actions and outputs, DNF objectives, custody, hostile groups, finales, dialogue
producers, bridges, and the private replay trace.

Validation fails unless:

- there is exactly one true finale site;
- recurring cases begin with one exact referred-contact action, which unlocks
  inactive approach and watch routes only after that contact succeeds;
- disappearance/loss cases retain independent physical and witness roots;
- every route can disclose the same site with a typed exact output;
- targets name materialized sites, areas, or persistent NPC authority;
- unusual selected relations have their event/evidence/lead bridge;
- every selected objective leaf has a concrete owning producer;
- disappearance objectives match the canonical cause and both terminal routes
  converge on the same person or asset;
- recurring combat alternatives name the same hostile group;
- every rare bridge names the exact reachable action that emits its exact
  evidence authority.

Unsupported cause/finale combinations are not selectable. Voluntary
disappearance is excluded until locate/testimony/report producers exist, and
generated templates do not select negotiation or capture without an owner.

## Persistence and privacy

Settlement generation writes the case, local problem, investigation authority,
evidence, action graph, custody, hostiles, finales, and private
`quest_generation_authority` in one reducer transaction. The latter stores the
seed, catalog revision, input snapshot, full manifest, and trace for replay. It
has no public table accessor. Gateway projections expose only symptoms and
observer-owned knowledge; browsers never receive canonical causes, traces,
undiscovered evidence, true/decoy status, or hidden coordinates.

Persistent settlement residents also cross that boundary through a dedicated
`BackendSettlementResident` projection. The projected row joins the ordinary
Character identity and age, private personality presentation, and
`SettlementResidentProfile` metadata. It contains the resident's stable decimal
character ID, home settlement, player-visible appearance, profession,
household, local role, service, and conversation identity. It deliberately
excludes private `sex` and the profile's internal `projection_id`; missing
Character or personality authority fails closed. Gateway-side
developer quest previews use visible age, presentation, profession, and role
for witness discovery. Preview, authoritative developer compilation, and later
victim-profile target validation share one visible-field candidate and
presence-commitment scheme. The scheme records presentation in that commitment
but leaves the candidate's sex selector empty for every presentation; it never
infers private sex from `Man`, `Woman`, or `Ambiguous`. Automatic procedural
generation remains a separate authoritative path and may use private
demographic truth.

The initial manifest remains immutable, but an unresolved generated problem
may acquire append-only follow-up incidents as authoritative world time
advances. At the template's authored interval, settlement activity materializes
the next due incident with a stable `(case, ordinal)` identity, occurrence time,
persistent NPC witness and victim binding, circumstance, existing case site,
canonical event, and new physical-evidence authority. Delayed refreshes
deterministically catch up every missed incident, with at most sixteen incidents
materialized by one reducer transaction. Fresh evidence is selected through the
same cause-and-site likelihood table and hard zeros as initial evidence.

The authored incident ceiling and thirty-day lifetime still govern non-hostile
families. A hostile `RecurringDepredation` instead remains active and continues
scheduled incidents until resolved. NPC adventuring companies and recruitment
offers remain, but companies no longer investigate, mitigate, or resolve
neglected cases automatically.

Every bestiary threat authors an escalation mode, growth rate, normalized
`baseline_combat_power`, and `investigability`. `10000` power is one unscaled
baseline orc. Higher investigability makes route actions,
physical inspection, and Bestiary interpretation easier. Mob escalation adds
bodies; single-entity escalation increases difficulty without multiplying
bodies or drops. Both derive progress from the incident ordinal using the
integer asymptotic recurrence. Count and per-enemy combat scale are monotonic;
normalized group power is
`ceil(count * baseline_combat_power * combat_scale_bps / 10000)` and is capped
globally at `300000`, thirty baseline-orc equivalents. This makes a strong solo
and a weak mob comparable instead of granting every species its own thirtyfold
ceiling. Valid authored baselines are `1000..=300000`; therefore per-enemy
combat scale is independently bounded at `3000000` basis points, the scale a
single minimum-baseline threat needs to reach the global power ceiling.
Tactical physical attributes and limb health consume
`sqrt(combat_scale_bps / 10000)` once, while damage-relevant training consumes
`combat_scale_bps / 10000` once; autoresolve uses the same physical multiplier
and has no low rating plateau. Mob loot remains per body; solo growth retains
baseline drop quantity. A hostile group persists its immutable base count,
difficulty, and per-enemy normalized power. A mission snapshots group version,
count, base difficulty, combat scale, normalized power, and loot when it binds,
so later incidents affect future missions without rewriting a pending or active
one.

Incident authority is private. A character who already knows the problem can
receive a dry local report when rumor circulation next reaches them; an
uninformed character receives no incident history, witness identity, evidence,
or location. Follow-up evidence remains undiscovered merely because its hidden
authority exists.

Each follow-up also advances private public awareness toward the threat's
`investigability * 100` cap:
`next = current + ceil((cap - current) * 3500 / 10000)`. At 6500 the case
becomes publicly known. A cap below 6500 can never cross, so elusive threats
remain investigation cases while conspicuous threats such as orcs and
skeletons eventually become combat-only problems. Catch-up records the
scheduled occurrence minute of the first crossing incident, never the later
refresh minute.

Once public, an authorized conversation grants only canonical threat type,
exact true site, and the current approximate count band (`one`, `a few`,
`several`, `a warband`, or `a horde`). It grants no evidence, testimony,
manifest, traces, or preparation advice and supersedes incorrect location
leads. The first referral also upserts one observer-safe journal entry and an
exact pin under the public case alias; repeat inquiries refresh its count band
without duplicating the case or journal row. Innkeepers at the afflicted and
adjacent settlements always qualify. Beyond adjacency, one listener-centric
shortest-road traversal is bounded to 4096 visited states, 16384 inspected
edges, and the maximum 18-by-25-km hearing distance. Cheap local graph scope
filtering happens before a deterministic 32-case manifest-validation cap, so
remote old cases cannot starve nearby cases. Missing or disconnected map nodes
fail locally and safely. Dues-current members may also ask the exact persistent
representative of an authored chapter whose organization explicitly enables
public threat referrals; membership uses the observer's authoritative
character clock and presentation is irrelevant. Both sources share the same
observer-scoped disclosure function.

Generated physical evidence has its own observer-facing presentation rather
than speaking through an NPC. At an exact, occupied case site, each visible
object is presented as a portrait with an italic initial observation and
clickable inspection topics for particular parts of the object. A topic may be
irrelevant, or it may test eyesight, intelligence, or instinct and reveal the
object's clue.

Inspection is an authoritative fixed-threshold comparison. The generator
assigns each checked topic a hidden, deterministic difficulty when it creates
the evidence; inspection never makes a random roll. A character therefore
gets the same result on every retry unless their relevant attribute changes.
The browser receives topic IDs, labels, and observed narration, but never the
difficulty or the character's compared value. Repeated attempts are allowed,
and only the first successful discovery records the clue in the journal.

Each accumulated incident increases the unresolved problem's trade,
encounter, and disease consequences by 25 percent of their initial values,
before the existing global safety caps and mitigation are applied. At the
currently authored five-incident ceiling, consequences are twice their initial
severity for non-hostile problems. Recurring hostile consequences continue to
use the existing global safety caps. Resolving or fully mitigating the linked
problem still suppresses all of those effects.

The private authority also stores a domain-separated SHA-256 commitment to the
exact serialized generation context, including observer-ID entropy. Every
authoritative consumer validates that commitment, row identities, seed,
catalog revision, factor trace, settlement scope, and the core manifest
invariants, then deterministically regenerates the complete manifest from the
stored context and requires exact equality. Observer IDs and generated state
are derived only after this validation; malformed or stale authority fails
closed instead of becoming manual behavior.

Canonical case IDs are used by objective authority. Journals use a separate
public case ID. The reducer samples a separate 128-bit observer-ID secret and
persists it only in generation authority. SHA-256 domain-separated IDs for
actions, witnesses, propositions, capabilities, leads, and outcomes are minted
from that secret; none embeds or is reproducible from canonical or other
browser-visible identifiers. Action resolution seeds are independently sampled
and persisted when capability authority is issued or revised. Exact retries are
idempotent, while a new version receives fresh entropy and a version-separated
roll.

Every private investigation capability also persists immutable provenance:
manual, or generated with its canonical generated-case identity. Generated
capabilities never fall back to manual behavior when authority or output rows
are missing. Projection, recovery, and execution reconstruct the opaque
capability ID from the private generation context and require its method,
target, terrain, prerequisite, alternate, summary, consequence, and typed
outputs to match the immutable manifest. Canonical and public case aliases are
resolved only through private indexed authority, with collisions rejected.
Private case/objective authority carries the same explicit manual-or-generated
provenance. Dialogue eligibility and execution share one validator: only an
explicitly manual case may use its current-NPC fallback, while a generated case
requires its immutable manifest, context, objective expression, and authored
dialogue producer to remain intact.

## Discovery and resolution

Entering an inn guarantees symptom discovery when an available unknown
**validated generated quest problem** exists. This records the rumor in the
player's dry journal and grants a private referral authority; it does not accept
a contract or disclose testimony. Legacy/manual seeded `LocalProblemAuthority`
rows currently drive settlement simulation modifiers and effects only and are
intentionally non-discoverable; retiring that producer is separate work. Any
local can repeat a validated generated rumor and name the referred persistent
NPC by visible description, profession, and expected location tab. Testimony is
issued only when the addressed NPC is the bound witness. Corrections reuse the
proposition they revise, preserving an earlier false believed pin until the
correction is learned.

Witness discovery is an explicit authored graph, not permission inferred from
private manifest membership. The initial rumor grants an observer-bound
referral to the primary witness. Individual testimony drafts may refer to exact
subsequent witnesses; only processing that account grants the next private
referral. The journal intentionally does not project that referral, its
location, or any suggested next action; those details remain in the dialogue
the player actually heard. Referral execution
revalidates observer, canonical/public case authority, NPC, settlement,
location, catalog revision, dialogue session, and live presence. Private
referral authority records whether it came from the exact initial rumor receipt
or an exact source witness and testimony draft; every use regenerates the
manifest and revalidates that provenance and its one authored edge. Missing,
cyclic, duplicate, or unreachable route-required witness edges fail generation
validation. Secondary testimony with no authored contact action changes no
route, while the primary contact still uniquely unlocks its successors.

Only an authoritative typed exact destination output can create an exact pin.
The raw site ID remains navigation authority; the matching map pin uses the
site's generated safe name. Witness-described sites use a neutral attribution
such as `Place Anna Weber described`; labels never comment on whether the
account is plausible or confirmed. The journal does not interpret or restate
the pin as a destination.
Discovery actions execute at a known contact, settlement, area, or predecessor
route and may reveal travel-capable knowledge. They never also resolve custody.
After travel establishes authoritative occupancy, a separate `InspectSite` or
`LayAmbush` action may resolve custody or prepare the finale. Retrieve and
rescue outputs use the versioned custody producer. Return and
expose use compiled generic dialogue responses, pre-issued bindings, the exact
generated recipient, and one-use consumption. Cases and linked local problems
may resolve without a contract.

Every generated investigation route makes bounded persistent progress without
replacing its native skill check. This includes physical searches and tracking,
contact-finding and approach actions, observation, patrol, and ambush routes.
Each attempt retains its ordinary skill-based chance, time, supplies, fatigue,
and risk, while contiguous failures on the exact same observer capability raise
the deterministic threshold until attempt six is guaranteed. Capability,
observer, method, or version gaps reset that progress; manual investigation
actions remain unbounded. Attempt authority and journal wording snapshot the
threshold, uncertainty, and six-attempt bound at resolution time.
When exact destination knowledge is corrected, dependent progress is matched
through validated private canonical/public case aliases. Unsupported routes
receive a fresh version and seed; an exact replacement that still supports the
same route preserves its contiguous work.

Attack patterns are playable modules rather than private flavor. Initial
surveillance remains pattern-neutral. Success earns one exact corroborated
pattern proposition; only then does the dependent action disclose and enforce
its nighttime window, roadside route, authored victim profile, or broad
schedule-free search. Unreliable testimony may contradict that proposition
until the evidence is learned, and the dependent capability requires knowledge
of the exact evidence ID and successful completion of its authored predecessor,
rather than inferring from the canonical event. Projection, failed-route
recovery, and execution all apply those same live-support requirements.
For a corroborated nighttime condition, the player-facing action projection
applies the same day/night gate as reducer execution. During daytime it exposes
the stable `night_window` reason code and an exact bounded `wait_minutes` until
minute 1200 of the current day, derived from public world time and the
furthest-advanced living party clock. It does not project the private event,
cause, or unlearned pattern authority.
Victim-specific patterns bind an opaque cohort reference to one persistent
settlement NPC in private authority, including their authored demographic and a
versioned presence fingerprint. The learned clue exposes only legitimate
demographic, physical, and referral details; patrol and ambush execution
revalidate the NPC's identity, profile, location, and availability immediately
before resolving the action.
The player-facing action projection applies the same current cohort-authority,
case-binding, NPC, presence, expected-place, profile, demographic, presence
version, and schedule predicates. If any no longer holds, the action remains
visible but unavailable with the single observer-safe `target_changed` reason;
the projection never identifies the NPC or reveals which private predicate
failed. This keeps alternate public actions usable while preventing a
permanently invalid cohort capability from remaining actionable.

Generated cases create no `Contract` rows. Tavern discovery and NPC referrals
are their entry points. Settlement activity counts open generated cases
directly and immediately replenishes resolved generated problems independently
of contract acceptance, tracking, reporting, or payment.

Recurring finales use the existing strategic mission authority from #217.
Pending `Defeat` and `DriveOff` leaves for the generated hostile group become
weighted `MissionOutcomeCandidate` rows after exact observer-authorized site
entry. Investigation never fabricates a battle result and no tactical tick
state is persisted.

Sapient, authored-negotiable hostile groups may also expose a private
pre-combat conversation at that exact site. Availability requires the current
observer-scoped pending `DriveOff` approach, an active group and open generated
case, no bound combat mission, the unique lowest-ordinal living hostile
counterparty, and a shared spoken language. The form
binds the public site, fixed hostile-context discriminator, spokesman, and
membership revision; it never exposes the private group or canonical case ID.
The response combines the actor's best live Charm/Command check on the normal
0-5 scale with language, the spokesman's current affinity, and authored hostile
morale. Refusal changes no case or group authority. Acceptance uses the
existing `DriveOff` / `HostilesDrivenOff` path, revokes sibling approaches, and
creates no battle, morale-victory, corpse, or loot rows.
Generated recurring-hostile cases also support a narrow whole-group surrender
alternative at the exact case site. Before combat, an eligible player may
demand surrender; when the authored awareness/morale policy elects it, the
hostile spokesman instead offers surrender and the player may accept or refuse.
Acceptance revalidates the exact party, case, site, group, living spokesman,
membership revision, pending objective, and absence of a bound mission before
marking the group surrendered and recording `HostilesSurrendered`. It creates no
battle, morale-victory, corpse, loot, custody, confiscation, or inventory rows.
Refusal leaves combat and negotiated withdrawal available and records only the
action receipt plus a small relationship consequence.

This initial surrender slice does not model tactical or mid-battle surrender,
random encounters, individuals, captivity, disarmament, parole, ransom,
release, escape, defection, recruitment, theft, or law enforcement. It is not a
general-purpose dialogue framework.

An observer can open a generated case site without a contract only after the
observer-owned exact pin and authoritative party occupancy agree on that site.
The location page uses the validated public problem summary and site label; it
does not synthesize a contract or expose the private manifest. Available
site-bound investigation actions continue through the normal authorized
investigation reducer. Strategic autoresolve is offered only when the
validated generated finale, a pending objective path, and an active hostile
group all bind the exact occupied site. Battle results are joined back to the
page by typed case-site authority rather than canonical/public case aliases.
The observer-safe case-site projection also exposes whether the generated case
has resolved, including noncombat finales that produce no battle result. A
resolved site shows an explicit completion notice and no longer offers
pre-finale rest controls.
Manual bounty pages retain their accepted-contract and active-contract gates.

## Investigations

Investigations are observer-specific knowledge, not a projection of canonical
quest truth. `adventuresim-core::investigation` models atomic propositions
through distinct perception, recollection, disclosure, transmission, belief,
revision, evidence, and lead stages. A witness can be sincerely mistaken,
omit one proposition, distort another, or later correct an account; there is no
witness-wide `is_lying` flag.

### Privacy boundary

The SpacetimeDB module keeps case truth, canonical events, stage records,
evidence authority, generation explanations, beliefs, revisions, leads, action
receipts, and sharing receipts in private tables. Only
`backend_investigation_journal`, `backend_investigation_leads`, and
`backend_case_site_pins` are public views. They fail closed for identities
other than the registered strategic gateway and omit hidden threats, causes,
sincerity, undiscovered evidence, private NPC identifiers, weights, bridges,
and hidden coordinates. The trusted SSR gateway additionally filters every
view to the selected session character. A case-site pin is joined to private
physical authority only when that observer has an unrevised exact-believed or
visited lead; textual and approximate leads cannot reveal coordinates.

The local-problem integration consumes a character-owned private rumor receipt
and derives an observer-facing case ID from the public problem ID. It never
projects `opaque_case_ref`, consults the problem cause, or silently grants a
contact's current location.

Generated cases privately map canonical, investigation, and public journal
identities. Dialogue eligibility accepts only those exact aliases plus
session-relevant rumor, testimony, belief, evidence, or custody provenance; it
never searches arbitrary cases the character happens to know.

Runtime testimony generation is a private production pipeline. Server-authored
perception, memory, disclosure, and transmission stages are persisted as a
private bundle, then issue a private, one-use, character-owned safe receipt.
Receiving that receipt records exact observer-owned provenance for the claim
and witness. The browser never authors or receives the hidden pipeline payload.
Player actions can only consume an existing matching receipt; they cannot
submit statement text, confidence, sources, or coordinates.

Compiled testimony patterns operate per proposition: an account may be
truthful, mistaken, evasive, deceptive, or partly truthful, including an
accurate event description paired with an omitted reason for being present.
Follow-up eligibility uses only observer-visible claims, contradictions,
familiarity, language/social checks, prior questioning, and possessed
evidence. The reliability pattern, motive, and canonical event remain private.

Evidence authority explicitly classifies presentation as physical or
informational. Physical evidence requires a custody row currently held by the
presenting party or character; a missing row fails closed. Informational
evidence requires a private, source-attributed
`investigation_evidence_knowledge` receipt. The mere existence of hidden
evidence authority—or a belief concerning the same proposition—does not grant
knowledge or physical possession of proof.

#### Physical inspection and Bestiary knowledge

Physical evidence exposes only safe topic IDs and labels. Its base attribute
thresholds, Bestiary thresholds, hidden case truth, and failed Bestiary checks
remain private. Once the physical inspection succeeds, the reducer evaluates
each authored atomic category implication against the inspecting character's
effective Bestiary knowledge. It never substitutes the party's best expert and
never consults the hidden threat.

Successful checks persist only observer-owned diagnostic-kind receipts and
safe interpretations. A failed physical observation creates no diagnostic
receipt. Generated testimony similarly creates an observer-owned report
receipt only after the private manifest is revalidated and the testimony is
actually received. Neither receipt can be supplied by the browser.

Whenever either input changes, the server calls the shared `infer_threats` and
`qualitative_deductions` functions using only that observer's received reports,
learned diagnostics, and the public regional context. It persists a deduplicated
set of possible monster kinds with `strong`, `plausible`, or `weak` support and
safe provenance. The journal and evidence conversation show those qualitative
candidates and their sources. Raw scores, basis points, percentages, hidden
thresholds, failed checks, canonical cause, and hidden evidence IDs never cross
the gateway. Identical visible report and diagnostic inputs therefore produce
identical deductions regardless of the hidden cause.

The SpacetimeDB module currently sets `test = false`, so ordinary Cargo tests
cannot instantiate a reducer database harness. Narrow pure tests cover action
receipt scope, canonical-row augmentation, duplicate suppression, stable
physical failure, success-only category filtering, and observer-safe
serialization. End-to-end reducer transaction behavior remains a live
database verification responsibility.

### Sharing and navigation

Knowledge belongs to a character. Sharing a selected lead or belief is an
explicit, idempotent action. The recipient must be living, in the same party,
and at the same strategic location at that moment. Joining or rejoining grants
no historical knowledge.

Destination knowledge advances from unknown through textual directions or a
landmark, an approximate area or route segment, exact believed location, and
observer-specific visited location. Only the last two stages may carry a pin.
An incorrect exact account remains the observer's destination until a sourced
correction revises it.

Generated corrections reuse the proposition ID they revise. A later witness or
evidence receipt creates the revision and marks the earlier lead corrected;
private materialization alone does not remove the observer's false pin.

Strategic destinations have stable case-site IDs independent of quests and
contracts. Character and party location, journey endpoints, camp continuation,
terrain planning, map links, and tactical scene selection all use the case-site
ID. A site's `case_id` may currently point to a legacy direct bounty, but
`Quest` contains no location, scene, coordinate, distance, or tracking fields.

Tracking is a private per-party presentation choice over an exact site already
known by the leader. It does not disclose the site, accept or abandon a
contract, move the party, satisfy an objective, start combat, or grant a
reward. Travel independently revalidates the leader's observer-safe exact
knowledge on every attempt and retry. Direct bounties seed a private site and
explicitly disclose it when the issuer accepts the contract, preserving the
prototype flow without making quest state the location authority.

Available-quest, quest-giver/service, issuer-route, and turn-in exclamation
markers are absent. Exact case-site pins are knowledge projections, not quest
markers. Reported exact locations and visited sites are labeled separately;
an active-contract badge appears only when the party's active contract
explicitly matches that case. Recruitment indicators are a separate social
feature.

### Threat inference

Player-facing ranking accepts only received descriptions, discovered evidence,
and visible regional priors. It delegates forward likelihoods and zero/rare
semantics to `bestiary::rank_candidates_in_region`; it has no inverse table and
cannot accept hidden `ThreatId` or case truth. Provenance names only inputs
already known to the observer.

### Strategic investigation actions

Gateway projections correlate every investigation action and public outcome
with the observer's public case ID. Generated canonical case IDs remain
private. A public case summary carries an immutable subject established by its
first observer journal entry; later leads and journal headlines update recency
without replacing it in summaries or evaluator events. Dialogue topic options
that advance a case carry that same public case
ID (presentation-only topics carry an empty value), so clients can never apply
a valid topic from one open case while attributing it to another. Public case
battle rows similarly contain the observer character and public case ID rather
than the canonical generated case ID; consumers must match observer, public
case, party, battle, mission, and exact site.

Investigation opportunities are private, versioned capabilities issued by the
strategic authority. The browser receives only an opaque action ID, method,
version, safe description, prerequisites, costs, uncertainty, and contribution
labels. Hidden case truth, target IDs, exact coordinates, deterministic seeds,
success thresholds, and weights never enter browser state.

The initial action vocabulary is inspect site, search area, follow or reacquire
tracks, locate a contact, watch, patrol, lay an ambush, and approach a lead.
Rumors materialize all nine as two linked routes: witness-led search and
observation-led interception. A recurring case begins with the exact referred
contact; succeeding there unlocks inactive approach and watch branches.
Disappearance/loss cases instead retain independent physical and witness roots.
Issuance validates that initial frontier shape. Execution revalidates the
immutable same-owner, same-case topology, while allowing the active frontier to
advance to a single non-contact successor such as a patrol only when its
authoritative predecessor attempt succeeded. Reissuing an already complete
generated graph validates its stored blueprints and evolved frontier without
reactivating initial roots; a partial generated graph fails closed.
Successful actions unlock their successors, and failed actions reactivate a
validated same-owner, same-case alternate. Failure text reports whether any
other currently live-supported case route remains, including a patrol already
supported by its exact clue. Approximate areas are private strategic geometry,
not client-authored destinations.
Resolution uses authoritative terrain, time of day, evidence age, relevant
skills, bounded party assistance, observer familiarity, and strategic weather.
Weather is queried from the actor's authoritative position and synchronized
action start time; clients cannot submit it. Heavy precipitation penalizes
visual field actions. Established snow can help track actions, while active
snowfall partly offsets that help by obscuring visibility. Clear weather
preserves the former resolution exactly, including the effective-skill clamp
and generated route's guaranteed sixth attempt.

Quest generation commits incident-time precipitation inside its private
replayed `GenerationContext`. Rain and snow select `PoorPerception` (and a
clear NightWindow selects `Darkness`) only at the perception/confidence stage.
Reliability, deception, evasion, demeanor, memory, and disclosure mappings
remain unchanged.

Every attempt is idempotent and consumes strenuous strategic time, including a
failed attempt. Failure may increase risk or uncertainty, but it does not
silently invalidate alternate investigation routes. Approximate discoveries
remain directions or areas. An exact map pin is disclosed only when an
authoritative result supports exact observer knowledge. Journal and map-pin
text use the site's safe generated name; opaque site IDs remain navigation
authority and are not shown as destination labels. Watches, patrols, and
ambush preparation remain strategic actions; they do not persist tactical tick
state and cannot fabricate a combat result.
After caller authorization, an exact existing attempt receipt is terminal
before living-character, party, or current leader checks; death and party
changes cannot make a committed request spend time again. A terminal injury or
disease clip writes an interrupted receipt in the same transaction as its time
effects. That receipt records no successful resolution, consequence, lead, or
uncertainty change. Its capability revision advances so a surviving observer
may make a distinct later request, while an exact retry of the clipped version
returns before interval effects.
Interrupted receipts and malformed private receipt payloads break the
contiguous completed-failure chain and grant no bounded-progress credit.
Before spending time the reducer revalidates party readiness, co-location,
journey and camp state, unresolved encounters, predecessor knowledge,
position, and typed prerequisites. Party clocks synchronize first, with night
defined as before 06:00 or from 20:00 onward. Browser estimates are broad
method-derived duration ranges; exact terrain, needs, fatigue, success, and
risk remain authoritative.

Exact-site attempts additionally pass through the shared strategic-action
planner using the canonical case-site place, the current opaque capability
revision, a private leader-or-approval rights decision, and a reducer-authored
snapshot/binding. The reducer replans at the final mutation boundary and
applies only the closed investigation interval and resolution effects. This
does not change replay receipts, deterministic formulas, mutation order, or
the public action DTO. Area and route actions remain on their existing path
until those domains have a canonical strategic-place identity; they must not
invent a case-site identity merely to enter the planner.
The rights provenance digest comes from that exact checked typed question
(actor subject, investigation resource and operation, and exact place or
explicit global jurisdiction), not from a parallel action tuple.

The planner's participant boundary suppresses completion effects, while the
domain interval effect intentionally retains the historical per-member full
duration request. Injury or disease clipping can therefore leave unequal
party clocks before the existing leadership/objective normalization. Changing
that behavior requires a separate party-time contract rather than an adapter
side effect.

Evidence-custody rows have an observer-private knowledge adapter with typed
subject, proposition, source, confidence, visibility, chronology, and initial
revision. Its numeric record key is only a deterministic adapter key; the
existing string primary key remains authoritative and adapters must reject a
collision between distinct persisted IDs. This adds no public evidence fields
and does not make hidden evidence authority sufficient proof by itself. Route
eligibility hydrates the record against the observer's exact personal clock;
malformed, future, cross-observer, or colliding records fail the entire check
closed.

Location is revalidated at execution, not merely at issuance. Contact actions
use the referred NPC's current settlement and presence window (or the same
settlement as a bound ask-around action). Physical tracking chains progress
from an area search through a route segment to a site. Every tracking edge must
remain same-owner and same-case, its predecessor must have succeeded, and
position validation recursively follows the coherent chain back to its area
origin. The same rule gates issuance, observer projection, and execution, so an
unexecutable successor is never advertised. Occupying another site from the
same case counts only when its valid coordinates fall within that area's meter
radius. Areas bind the origin settlement's coordinate
mode: imported geographic worlds use great-circle meters, while abstract maps
use the strategic-travel convention of Euclidean coordinate units as
kilometers. Site and area modes must agree. Later
site-targeting actions require actual site occupancy. Traveling elsewhere
invalidates the attempt before time is spent or a lead is written.

Retrieve and rescue consequences re-read current custody and require the case
objective, object kind, site holder, occupied site, and next version to agree. A
purely stale version reissues the capability without spending time; a holder,
site, or case mismatch fails closed. Investigation can discover, track,
position, and prepare an ambush, but it never creates a mission, battle receipt,
hostile disposition, drive-off fact, or capture fact. Authoritative non-kill
tactical resolution begins only after authenticated combat succeeds. Strategic
mission authority privately snapshots exact observer-authorized pending
objective approaches and deterministically selects among compatible defeat,
drive-off, and capture consequences at commit time. Investigation actions cannot
select or invoke that result.

## Disease evidence hooks

The investigation catalogue includes open physical traces for fantastic
disease: night-sylph castings, waterborne grave mould, salamander-opened rye
galls, and pygmy-tended ore biofilm.
Disease definitions attach weights and optional site constraints to these IDs.
Generators must combine them with visible exposure timing, environment,
Bestiary knowledge, and other clues; they must not select evidence by revealing
a patient's hidden disease identity. These hooks anticipate corpse examination
and outbreak quest work but do not implement either system. See
[Fantastic diseases](../shared/fantastic-diseases.md).
