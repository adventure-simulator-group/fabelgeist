# Map

## Weather overlays

The imported Plains, Forest, Hills, Wetlands, and Urban mixture remains an
immutable normalized five-member description of the land. Strategic weather
does not rewrite that source data. Rain derives a temporary effective mixture
at journey departure: cells below 100/1000 Wetlands absorb rain without
becoming wetlands, while susceptible cells gain Wetlands and deterministically
renormalize the displaced underlying weights. A separate bounded saturation
value slows travel through mud and waterlogging, including terrain already at
100% Wetlands.

Snow cover is a separate overlay, never a sixth biome weight. It blends Snow
expertise with the ordinary terrain check. Cover splits the road-discounted
training budget between Snow and the underlying biome rather than duplicating
exposure.

The terrain profile affects strategic routing and can select tactical scene
context. Tactical scene generation now has a shared versioned input boundary:
production sampling and named synthetic fixtures provide the same playable
heights, environmental coverage, immutable weather, and multi-LOD vista samples.
Inputs coarser than two metres are deterministically bilinearly upsampled and
receive bounded seeded microrelief before the tactical server builds its
collider and replicates the heightfield. Each client builds the render mesh from
those same samples, so presentation, movement, and ground queries share one
authoritative surface without sending mesh data. The tactical server owns the
playable collider; coarse vista data is presentation-only and is not tactical
tick state or SpacetimeDB state. Generated tree trunks and rocks are
server-authoritative static movement obstacles. Trees replicate a compact kind
and transform; rocks additionally replicate a seed, archetype, lithology,
dimensions, and conservative collision radius. The server creates only static
primitive colliders. Each client samples the recipe and extracts a low-poly
Surface Nets mesh constrained inside the collider; no render mesh is generated
or transmitted by the server. Trees use a seeded four-order branch skeleton and
five smoothly cross-faded presentation levels: real tapered wood with individual
veined leaf cards, leafed-twig impostors, small-branch impostors, crown-branch
impostors, and finally one camera-facing whole-tree billboard. Each successive
level collapses exactly one botanical order. Every aggregate card derives its
position and extent from the actual seeded descendant twigs, so crown mass,
asymmetry, and gaps remain recognizable through the transitions while retaining
parallax longer than a direct crown-to-billboard swap. Runtime atlas generation
rasterizes low-sided woody silhouette tubes and progressively sampled,
coverage-compensated leaves rather than rebuilding the multi-million-triangle
production bark and leaf meshes for every card. The directly viewed near trunk,
root flare, and leaf cards remain the full production meshes. Oak bark relief is
evaluated in its near-tree material from three scalar-height projections whose
growth coordinates follow the metric branch sweep. Its packed ambient occlusion
combines a half-resolution broad horizon with full-resolution local cavity
sharpening. Bounded mip-aware near-camera parallax and a three-step
dominant-light horizon add view-dependent cavity depth without altering the mesh
or tactical collider. The complete load-bearing trunk and root system is one
bounded implicit surface, eliminating the unrelated mesh
loops and normal discontinuity of a flare/tube handoff. Swept higher-order
branches duplicate their cylindrical wrap position and normal exactly. Bark
fissure phases vary deterministically per specimen and close into irregular
plates, so no permanent groove advertises that wrap. Intermediate crown wood
excludes the depth-zero root flare because the separately streamed trunk remains
resident, avoiding duplicate geometry and duplicate Surface Nets construction.
Oak terminal shoots occur in separated pulses along each secondary axis. Their
compact leaf flushes form a handful of readable foliage masses with stable
interior windows instead of a uniformly noisy twig lattice. Every aggregate tree
card is baked from this same clustered source geometry, preserving those masses
and gaps across LOD transitions. Unresolved canopy occlusion is bounded and
paired with diffuse leaf transmission so crown interiors remain legible in
WebGPU without a separate subsurface or screen-space effect. The individual-leaf
crown uses an 8-triangle cambered PBR card and a 30-triangle terminal bud. Once
that camber falls below useful screen size, each leaf cross-fades to a
two-triangle flat PBR card before terminal shoots collapse into twig cards. Both
leaf stages use the same generated oak front/back albedo, DirectX normal maps,
AO/roughness, and opacity mask; the cambered card supplies close depth and
foreshortening while the mask preserves one lobed silhouette throughout the
transition. Both stages retain the same biological attachment, two-sided
shading, per-leaf shade variation, and vertex-shader wind phase. Seven stable
primary scaffold clusters each carry their own individual leaves, terminal buds,
progressively simplified wood, leafed-twig cards, small-branch cards, and crown
cards. Projected screen size is evaluated from the active camera's field of view
and viewport height against each cluster's own bounds, so the far side of a
nearby crown may collapse before the near side. Dither bands cross-fade adjacent
representations without a whole-tree topology pop. The cheap aggregate tiers
deliberately overlap their full-strength intervals: the incoming silhouette
fades in before the outgoing, non-identical silhouette fades away, preventing
transition holes. Only the final distant billboard is selected for the entire
tree. Generated variants reuse cached mesh and material handles, allowing Bevy's
WebGPU renderer to instance repeated trees automatically. The cache initially
retains only the deterministic branch/leaf recipe output and shared materials.
Trunks, detailed scaffold meshes, the cambered and flat leaf representations,
aggregate crown wood, and each baked atlas are generated only when the camera's
conservative LOD-residency mask first requests them. The two individual-leaf
meshes coexist only in a widened handoff band; a camera wholly inside either
leaf tier does not construct the other representation merely because it belongs
to the same tree. This is demand generation rather than eviction: once
requested, a variant's handles remain cached for reuse during the scene. Leaf
wind is evaluated in the vertex shader with fixed petiole roots, spatially
varied gusts, and high-frequency tip flutter; no per-frame CPU deformation or
non-WebGPU feature is required. The open-grown reference LOD0 is capped by test
at 3.6 million triangles, versus roughly 9.1 million before leaf and bud
retopology. The scene's world-data canopy coverage also shapes the source
skeleton continuously: sparse coverage yields low, wide open-grown trees, while
dense coverage yields taller trees whose first scaffold branches sit above the
clear bole. This value is part of deterministic generation rather than a query
over spawned neighbors, preserving parallel tree construction.

Playable terrain also carries a replicated, authoritative `SceneGround` grid
aligned with its height samples. Each location has one semantic substrate, one
mutually exclusive cover profile, bounded cover density, and cover height. The
tactical server retains the CPU grid and exposes world-position queries; this
is the future boundary for concealment, footsteps, tracks, and traversal, but
those gameplay consumers are not implemented yet. The client uploads a packed
copy as the terrain material map and uses the same values for deterministic
scatter. Texture asset identifiers are presentation details and never become
server authority.

For rendering, the client deterministically expands that coarse categorical
map and displaces its lookup boundary with two scales of smooth noise. The
shader still selects exactly one cover material at every fragment—there is no
colour-gradient blend—but boundaries such as forest floor against grass no
longer expose square source-grid cells.

Generated tree crowns stamp leaf-litter cover into this grid. Grass macro
patches conservatively reject any footprint intersecting those cells. Separate
shared meshes scatter a dense dry-leaf carpet and a looser layer of longer
twigs with independent deterministic placement over the warmer forest-floor
material. Open soil remains tall grass, wet ground selects reeds,
and sufficiently hilly samples select loose stone; these profiles are mutually
exclusive at a location even when one profile renders several compatible
details. Loose-stone cells use low-frequency site fields stretched along the
local fall line to form open ground, sparse margins, and coherent dense scree
trains instead of a uniform pebble carpet. Two density-preserving shared mesh
families retain the same individual stones through hero, near, and
camera-facing billboard LODs. Their candidate lattice is coarse enough to
avoid routine overlap, and their rounded bases extend slightly below the
terrain so grazing views read embedded stones rather than open polygon caps.
These non-colliding separately shaded instances do not enter the foliage wind
or player-bending shader.

The bounded client Surface Nets extractor is reusable infrastructure for future
sparse volumetric terrain patches, but this iteration does not define a cave,
cliff, overhang, heightfield-collar, or traversability schema. Those patches
must eventually replicate compact deterministic field recipes rather than
meshes. Their server collision and ground-query contract must be designed
without moving render-mesh extraction into the dispatcher or tactical server.

Grass, shrubs, reeds, leaves, and twigs are deterministic shared-mesh foliage
with no gameplay collider. Grass uses overlapping 3.2-metre shared macro patches
containing 9,216 individually oriented ribbons: each nearby blade samples a
cubic longitudinal curve with fifteen vertices, then cross-fades to a stable
1,600-blade subset using seven vertices per ribbon. The retained blades widen by
the square root of the density ratio, preserving aggregate coverage while
eliminating the rejected blades before vertex shading. Internal blade spacing
matches the former one-metre patch, so the larger footprint cuts grass render
entities by roughly an order of magnitude without reducing near-field density.
Canopy, water, cultivation, and snow select stable blades within the shared mesh
rather than opening macro-patch-sized holes. On native builds the playable sward
renders through GPU instancing (`bevy_eidolon`): the same placement rules emit
per-tuft instances that a compute pass culls per instance, while the browser
client keeps the macro-patch renderer. Both representations evaluate the
same authored lean, layered spatial wind, and player displacement curve, and an
edge-on ribbon turns partially toward the view so it retains useful screen width
without becoming a full billboard. Grass placement is not clipped to the
authoritative playable heightfield. One globally aligned placement domain spans
both playable terrain and the first presentation-only vista ring. Every eligible
location owns the same overlapping camera-distance-selected near, far, and vista
representations; the gameplay boundary only switches the source of height and
environmental coverage data. LOD fade distance is evaluated at each blade root
and complementary dithering is applied in the foliage fragment shader, so a
3.2-metre patch cannot switch as one visible square. A single continuous
coverage mask copies authoritative playable detail, then blends over twelve
metres into regional sward coverage; the playable rectangle itself is never
baked in as a grass-free border. Near ribbons fade into seven-vertex far
ribbons, which fade into 6.4-metre patch impostors containing 576 broad,
five-vertex tuft silhouettes. Regional coverage is sampled continuously per
blade rather than quantized into four patch-wide density levels or used to
discard entire macro patches, so ecological variation does not create square
holes. These are materially different geometry rather than blades merely
discarded in the vertex shader, following the high/low geometry and far-field
impostor division described in Eric Wohllaib's GDC 2021
[*Procedural Grass in Ghost of Tsushima*](https://gdcvault.com/play/1027033/)
talk. They fade by 40 metres. Beneath the close Near tier, the terrain keeps the
local solid soil, litter, mud, cultivation, or stone substrate instead of
painting grass green onto the ground. During the 8--10 metre Near-to-Far
cross-fade, a stable world-space dither introduces the same optical-average
grass pigment only in the physical coverage removed by Far's subset; its
surviving blades retain their full width above it. That gap fill remains through
the Far and Vista tiers, then grows continuously to full coverage as the final
Vista blades fade from 35 to 40 metres. The pigment derives from the same
environmental grass palette and compensates for the species/cohort darkening,
blade occlusion, and thin-foliage lighting that act after the blade input color.
This solid terminal LOD carries the field without sub-pixel geometry or exposing
a differently colored silhouette when the last blades disappear. Regional vista
vertices retain the same environmental samples, including an aggregate
sward-coverage channel, and hard world-space coverage dithering selects that
same calibrated pigment through every vista ring. Vista slopes use continuous
height-gradient normals instead of per-cell face normals; sufficiently exposed
hilly samples reuse the generated two-color rock surface through coarse-safe
triplanar sampling. The locally controlled player's position and velocity
flatten and push nearby grass as a presentation-only effect.

Grass is organized into deterministic, roughly 24-metre coherent plant
communities rather than selecting an unrelated species for every ribbon.
Mesic lowland swards combine tall false oat-grass (`Arrhenatherum elatius`)
with broader, clustered cocksfoot (`Dactylis glomerata`); lean or exposed
swards combine fine red fescue (`Festuca rubra` aggregate) with airy common
bent (`Agrostis capillaris`); damp openings combine tufted hair-grass
(`Deschampsia cespitosa`) with Yorkshire fog (`Holcus lanatus`). Existing
wetland, water, cultivation, hilliness, moisture, local vista samples, and
stable low-frequency site fields are temporary habitat inputs until world data
carries vegetation communities. Dry sites assign no token wet-tussock cells.
Species presets change physical blade height, width, pigment region, and
near-LOD panicle form. Articulated rachis and branch ribbons carry crossed
two-plane spikelets, distinguishing open oat, bent, and hair-grass panicles
from denser cocksfoot clusters. These rigid seed-head clusters inherit the
parent stalk's wind and player-interaction bend at their attachment point
without being reconstructed as blade ribbons. Far and vista LODs drop that
sub-pixel geometry while preserving the same patch footprint and community
identity.

Ordinary temperate understory shrubs use shared procedural common-hazel
(`Corylus avellana`), blackthorn (`Prunus spinosa`), and common-hawthorn
(`Crataegus monogyna`) presets rather than unique meshes per scatter point. The
reusable multi-stem shrub form parameterizes physical height, crown, stem-count,
shoot, leaf dimensions, petiole, bark relief, and leaf material. Stable
four-by-four scatter-cell communities create roughly 13-metre thickets: hazel is
weighted toward mesic shade and remains eligible on woodland leaf litter,
blackthorn toward bright dry scrub, and hawthorn toward open or cultivated edges
and woodland gaps. Community-scale density structure groups the same approximate
shrub population into dense cores, loose margins, and open relief instead of
distributing every specimen at a uniform cadence. Cambered near leaves and flat
alpha-card far leaves share generated, palette-constrained
albedo/opacity/normal/AO/roughness materials and the existing tree-leaf wind
shader. Mature tree presentation additionally supports common beech
(`Fagus sylvatica`). Its preset has a straight high-clear bole, compact
ascending scaffolds, smooth gray bark relief, and ovate subtly wavy leaves
instead of reusing oak roots, fissures, or gnarling. Stable 30-metre communities
weight beech toward moist, closed-canopy woodland. The same local community
selector does not delete grass macro patches: actual overlapping crown-litter
footprints and the scene-wide canopy density suppress the forest floor, avoiding
square holes in otherwise unoccupied habitat cells. The species-specific bark
and leaf palette is carried through playable and regional tree LODs, including
the software-baked whole-tree billboard. For now the compact server obstacle
remains the conservative generic `Tree` collider and the client derives oak
versus beech deterministically from replicated scene environment and position;
an explicit species field can replace that temporary selection rule without
changing generator recipes. Root self-shadow and a darker centre rib are
occlusion responses; a small solid-color palette and softened upward normals
keep the dense field readable without making individual cards look heavily lit.
A procedural terrain material selects hard-bounded forest floor, dry ground,
mud, cultivation, stone, water, and snow albedo regions. Both playable and vista
ground omit sampled photographic albedo. Near walkable soil adds one shared
1024-square RG8 height/AO sample with a complete mip chain; world-XZ mapping and
screen-space height derivatives perturb the geometric normal without storing a
normal map. The two-metre tile represents sub-two-centimetre compacted earth,
hollows, clods, and fine aggregate, then fades from 12 to 24 metres and is
suppressed on steep, stone, gravel, water, and snow-covered surfaces. A
camera-local 40-metre detail patch refines the underlying geometric normal
response to a 25-centimetre grid without changing the authoritative two-metre
collider. Its world-space, centimetre-scale relief is deterministic and fades to
the source surface over the outer 4.5 metres. The residual height is signed and
bounded to roughly seven centimetres down and ten centimetres up: broad soil
undulation and sparse clods break up flat ground; local terrain gradients orient
narrow drainage rills downhill and soil-creep ridges across slopes; concavity
gathers a shallow sediment layer. Water stays flat. Road samples infer the local
road axis and edges from authoritative ground semantics, then form a raised
crown and paired compacted wheel ruts. Nearby replicated tree positions add a
shallow mound, basin, and several long curved radial root ridges, tying the
ground silhouette to the generated roots instead of applying unrelated noise.
Stone and gravel suppress soil clods in favor of broad contour-following bedrock
ledges and sparse intersecting fractures. Nearby replicated boulders carve a
shallow visual socket, build a contact apron, and deposit a widening downhill
debris tail, so the rock mass meets the landform instead of resting on a flat
plane. These obstacle-aware residuals remain presentation-only and do not alter
the authoritative terrain height or conservative colliders. These process layers
are geometry, never baked albedo or normal detail. A camera-centred shader
cutout removes the coarse base only beneath the safely covered patch interior,
allowing signed channels to remain visible instead of being depth-occluded. The
outer 1.5-metre overlap retains the base terrain and a small fixed-function
depth bias resolves the almost fully morphed, coplanar perimeter without a
second texture or non-WebGPU shader stage. The patch snaps in one-metre
increments and retains the nearest vista height samples, so its quality radius
follows the camera across the playable boundary. Its PBR response modestly
expands the lateral components of the actual refined geometry normals and lowers
dry roughness within the patch; this preserves solid albedo while keeping
centimetre-scale facets legible under the bright environment-light floor. This
is bounded CPU-generated triangle refinement that runs on WebGPU's ordinary
vertex/fragment pipeline, not unavailable hardware tessellation or native-only
mesh shaders. Tree-canopy ground is presented as a deterministic ecological
sequence rather than a binary grass cutout. A high-resolution signed distance
field derived from authoritative leaf-litter cover blends dark loam, shaded
soil, and open soil and grades grass density and height across a 4.8-metre
exterior band. The canopy floor adds shared, fully mipped 1024-square aggregate
litter surface and normal maps. Their four-metre world-space tile uses the same
dry-oak blade envelope as the scattered leaves and packs sub-two-centimetre
relief, ambient occlusion, muted palette selection, and overlapping leaf
coverage while retaining small soil gaps. A coarser upper stratum preserves
individual 10--16-centimetre silhouettes over two denser composting strata. A
bounded grazing-angle parallax
offset and explicit normal response give that relief depth without adding a
shell layer. The aggregate supplies the continuous litter mass; it does not
carry authored photographic color. Procedural fallen-leaf and twig meshes are
distributed in smaller batches with several independent placement passes and a
compressed dry-brown pigment range to break the surface silhouette without
reproducing every leaf as geometry. Each leaf variant mixes 56
jittered-stratified leaves with 28 loose clustered leaves; four-fifths remain
seated within four millimetres while the remainder may curl above the bed.
Multi-segment shade-plant rosettes extend into the outer 3.2 metres. Sparse
brown-gray woodland pebble patches remain continuous across leaf-litter cells
and average roughly one visible 3--8-centimetre stone per square metre without
enabling the dense loose-stone billboard field. These stones use flattened,
irregular outlines and buried bases instead of smooth exposed spheres. No shell
layers are used. Tree sampling follows
canopy coverage; open-ground rock sampling uses an independent deterministic
roll scaled by hilly coverage, so the two features do not suppress one another.
Weather affects ground wetness/snow tint, bounded rain or snow particles, wind
drift, sunlight transmission, and distance fog. Clear weather retains a subtle
kilometre-scale contrast haze beyond tactical gameplay range. At the playable
boundary, the first vista ring reuses exact edge heights and eases the solid
substrate pigment over several regional samples while preserving its independent
geometric-sward coverage. Coarse vista samples preserve local peaks and render
as seam-sharing rings of independently culled 32-by-32-cell mesh chunks out to
50 km. Chunking changes only CPU/ECS submission and culling granularity, not
regional sampling or visible tessellation, and avoids tens of thousands of
startup-time entities; coarser rings leave the playable and finer-ring interiors
open rather than overdrawing them. The 50-metre and 250-metre regional rings
also deterministically scatter bounded samples of the production whole-tree
impostor over canopy-bearing cells; the outer ring relies on aggregate canopy
colour. Those presentation-only trees share one cached atlas family, have no
gameplay collider, and are seated on the same morphed vista surface as the
terrain. Tree stand sampling scales with physical cell area instead of capping
the first 250-metre ring to three silhouettes. Exposed terrain likewise
continues rocks beyond the playable rectangle: a shared procedural mesh hands
off to a twelve-face silhouette mesh, then to the vista terrain's aggregate rock
palette before either representation becomes subpixel. None of this vista
scatter gains collision or server authority.

Near-tree PBR leaf cards participate in the horizon-aware directional shadow
map, producing both cast shadows and leaf-on-leaf self shadow. Their vertex data
also carries a deterministic canopy-visibility term that darkens protected
interior foliage without relying on native screen-space ambient occlusion, which
is unavailable on WebGPU. The same alpha cutoff and CPU-synchronized wind phase
are used by forward, depth/prepass, and shadow passes so moving leaf silhouettes
remain aligned. Aggregate distant tree LODs do not cast individual leaf shadows.
Hazard mechanics remain future work;
[#212](https://github.com/adventure-simulator-group/fabelgeist/issues/212)
tracks that handoff and committed-result contract. The world map is a grid where
each square has a height and an enum for the terrain type. Each of these affect
both the speed of travel and the difficulty of climb/swim check to avoid injury.
We should not try and create our own, we should be able to find both height and
biome data from some open GIS dataset. At minimum, it should be easy to find
modern data for these, but there may also be a historical dataset that we can
use.

The strategic import records a bounded terrain profile on each road/ferry edge:
elevation, ascent/descent, grade, slope/aspect, roughness, relief, landforms,
water adjacency, and versioned seasonal/encounter tags. Because the historical
road source has endpoint topology but no polyline, these facts explicitly use
straight endpoint geometry. They select strategic travel and possible scenes;
a tactical server still owns all live terrain interaction.

## Height
Traveling from a lower height to a higher one may require the characters to make
a climb check (based on upper body strength vs weight) based on the slope, and
traveling from higher to lower may require the characters to make an agility
check.

## Terrain Type
As this is an enum, we can store extra information in each variant. For example,
the "River" variant could include its depth and velocity, both of which would
contribute to how hazardous it is to ford.

In addition to the costs imposed to traveling, it may also affect stealth and
detection. Forest cover may largely prevent detection from flying enemies but
also make it much easier for an enemy to ambush you, presenting a trade-off of
risk which you might assess based on which enemies are known to exist in an area
and which you are better able to defend against.

## Pathfinding
As described in the [travel](../strategic/travel.md) page.

# Weather
This probably isn't worth putting in the MVP, especially for such a temperate
place like Italy, but eventually there should be a weather map that affects the
way that you travel though terrain. Heavy snow would slow down land travel,
frozen lakes and rivers become possible to cross without swimming (but also
risky if the ice is thin), and rain makes climbing very difficult.

# Points of Interest
For the MVP, there is no need for any point of interest other than enemy
camps/lairs/nests relevant to active [quests](../strategic/quests.md) in an area
as well as [settlements](../strategic/settlement.md). The former are simply
placed randomly (though not too close to any other point of interest), the
latter should be obtained from a GIS dataset. If we can't find *historical* GIS
data on Italian settlements then we can just use modern data and rely on
[Cunningham's Law](https://meta.wikimedia.org../Cunningham%27s_Law) to fix it.

# Underground
In our setting, there is ostensibly a vast underground network of caves, crypts,
tunnels, Ratling under-cities, Dwarven strongholds, and even antediluvian ruins.
But this sounds hard, therefore we shouldn't bother with it for the MVP. All of
the quests will conveniently take you to overland locations, which don't even
need to have structures.

## Foraging

Personal foraging trains only the Plains, Forest, and Hills leaf skills in the
normalized mixture of the character's current 1 km vicinity. The Terrain
heading remains a presentation aggregate and is never awarded or stored.
Cultivated ground affects legality, not the biome mixture. High Game, Low Game,
Fish, Harmful Beasts, and Plants divide one selected search-time budget; source
availability follows the local habitat rather than selecting another vicinity.
