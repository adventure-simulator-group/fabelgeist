# Historical equipment catalog

This document records the first equipment slice for issue #65: weapons,
shields, and armor intended for northern Germany in approximately 1544. The
definitions are canonical typed records in `content/items/catalog.yaml`,
compiled and embedded by `adventuresim-core` as described in
[Item definition authoring](../contributing/item-authoring.md). The strategic
game and the
autoresolver consume the same persisted `Item` records; there are no special
NPC-only item rules.

## Scope and historical basis

The core professional infantry set is pike-and-shot equipment with halberds,
sidearms, and armor. The German History in Documents and Images description of
an approximately 1532--42 Landsknecht procession identifies the pike as the
typical weapon. The Musée Lorrain's description of imperial Landsknecht
equipment identifies pikes and halberds as the main bodies, supplemented by
crossbowmen and arquebusiers, and notes Nuremberg mass production of infantry
armor from the 1540s. The Met describes the halberd as especially associated
with German Landsknechts, while noting the pike's role in massed sixteenth
century formations.

The catalog also deliberately includes usable older stock: the baselard,
barbute, sallet, visored sallet, mail garments, heater shield, and longbow.
These are not presented as the fashionable or preferred 1544 battlefield kit;
they are plausible inherited, stored, civilian, militia, or second-hand goods.
No later sixteenth-century weapons or armor types are included simply for
variety.

The catalog intentionally has more weapons than armor entries (26 weapons to
24 armor pieces). Helmets receive eight entries because they were independently
useful, highly varied, and more likely than a complete suit to persist in an
armory.

Shield statistics preserve an actual handling tradeoff rather than making one
catalog entry a strict upgrade. The round shield weighs 3.0 kg and provides 3.0
block, while the heater shield weighs 3.5 kg and provides 3.5 block. A player
therefore chooses between lower burden and greater protection.

## Representation and gameplay inference

### Parametric melee weapon instances

Melee weapons have a versioned procedural design in addition to their catalog
definition. The catalog entry remains the semantic chassis and supplies names,
fallback icons, equipment placements, and combat tags. Each concrete weapon
design is stored once in the private `WeaponInstance` table, keyed by the stable
`InventoryObject.id`; personal and party transfers therefore change custody
without changing the weapon or its smithing parameters. Dimensions are quantized
in millimetres and ratios in permille before persistence. The same validated
recipe deterministically produces its design hash, closed triangle meshes,
material groups, grip and tip anchors, and a geometric summary. Catalog weight,
reach, and equipment dimensions remain authoritative for gameplay until
procedural measurements have been calibrated across both layers.

The ordinary strategic inventory continues to show the catalog presentation,
condition, compact weight/value summaries rather than hundreds of smithing
parameters. Future smithing and detailed inspection views may request the
complete recipe for the selected physical object. Tactical handoff sends only
the selected character's validated recipe and compact geometric summary. The
tactical client expands that recipe into cached meshes keyed by generator
version and design hash; corrupt or unsupported recipes fall back to the
ordinary equipment box without affecting authoritative combat state.

Inventory icons are deterministic orthographic silhouettes of that same
validated mesh rather than a second authored representation of a custom
weapon. Sword-family icons place the guard at the exact center, keep the
complete handle in the upper right, and let the blade continue beyond the
lower-left edge of the square. Other melee weapons place the root of the head
at the exact center, keep the complete head in the upper left, and let the shaft
continue beyond the lower-right edge. The CPU renderer uses a slightly oblique
view, supersampling, and semantic-anchor framing so guards, rings, axe heads,
and hammer polls remain legible at inventory scale while the intentionally
cropped length does not make compact heads look tiny. Rendered masks are cached
by weapon generator version, design hash, icon-renderer version, and raster
settings.

Head-focused framing first fits the complete head-and-socket assembly, then
permits the actual head geometry to grow by at most two times around its
centered root. Growth stops when the complete head reaches the inset upper-left
safety boundary or the zoom cap, whichever comes first; long sockets and langets
may therefore crop with the shaft instead of making a small poll or beak
illegible. A headless walking staff treats its uppermost 120 millimetres as a
synthetic head, producing the same upper-left-to-lower-right composition without
an unbounded point-sized fit.

The strategic page still does not embed recipes or smithing parameters. Its
authenticated icon endpoint resolves the stable inventory object, verifies
that the active character may see its current personal or party custody,
authenticates the versioned recipe and design hash, and only then uses the
transient cache. Legacy catalog weapons and failed or unsupported recipes keep
their authored catalog icon.

The tactical slot grid, active-hand and off-hand controls, and selected ground
item use the same silhouette renderer locally from the authenticated replicated
`WeaponAppearance`. They cache the resulting Bevy image by the same generator,
design, renderer, and raster identity used by the strategic renderer.
Replication arrival is order-independent because the HUD resolves appearances
every frame; non-weapons and invalid or unsupported recipes retain the tactical
catalog atlas icon. The tactical world model continues to use the full generated
mesh, not the silhouette.

Generated holders use their own persisted holder recipe rather than borrowing
the contained weapon's icon. A blade sheath mirrors the sword composition: its
complete throat and suspension begin in the inset upper-left and its fitted body
continues toward, and may crop at, the lower-right. Compact haft loops fit their
complete loop-and-hanger assembly inside the square. Strategic holder icons use
the same custody-gated endpoint and tactical holder icons use the replicated
`WeaponHolderAppearance`; both reauthenticate the holder recipe and design hash
before consulting their caches.

Each generated scabbard or haft loop is a first-class parametric object with a
versioned `WeaponHolderDesign` template and a private `WeaponHolderInstance`
keyed by its stable physical object. Its recipe captures the fitted weapon
shape plus independent clearance, furniture, material, and suspension
parameters. Drawing or later altering the weapon therefore does not silently
change the holder; refitting is an explicit smithing/leatherworking operation.
Deleting the holder cascades its instance row, while deleting the original
weapon leaves the independently reproducible holder intact.

Equipment authors one or more stable-ID placements. Root placements claim
physical body locations in an explicit occupancy channel and order; attached
placements require compatible points on already equipped parents. A placement
can require several parent points and can mix those edges with body occupancy.
A `mail_shirt` therefore occupies its authored torso locations at the flexible
armor channel while a brigandine can cover the same locations at the rigid
armor channel. A multi-location equip or reparent either claims every
destination or changes nothing; conflicts are reported before mutation.
Sided pieces provide explicit left and right placement alternatives.

The normalized equipment graph supports body → belt → fitted sheath or haft loop
→ weapon, body → belt → bag → contents, and body → forearm/boot sheath → weapon.
The catalog sword sheath uses two belt mount requirements, exercising
multi-point attachment against the belt's ordered mount points. Generated
non-newborn characters whose loadout contains a sheathable weapon receive a worn
belt and one fitted holder per weapon. Blades use generated scabbards; compact
axes, clubs, maces, and hammers use generated haft loops. An initially held
weapon stays held; an unequipped sidearm begins inside its holder. Polearm
loadouts receive no irrelevant carry kit. This materialization is deterministic
and versioned with the starting-character generator. Attachment points have an
authored channel, traversal order, capacity, and optional accepted child tags.
Removing or moving an item with children is rejected in player-facing reducers,
so no operation can orphan descendants.

The equipment topology is finer than the stable seven-part combat and health
model. Each placement explicitly lists the stable body parts it protects;
physical location never implies protection. A boot knife or holster therefore
adds no foot or leg armor. Layered protection folds each authored mapping into
its combat body part: padding and
resistance sum, coverage is `1 - product(1 - coverage)`, range of motion uses
the minimum, and flexibility is resistance-weighted (defined as zero when
total resistance is zero). Contact wear applies only to the deterministic
outermost applicable item.

Weapons carry an explicit distribution across Polearm, Axe, Bludgeon, Sword,
Knife, Bow, Crossbow, Firearm, and Throw. Hybrid weapons split equally among
their applicable tags: a halberd is Polearm/Axe/Bludgeon, a glaive is
Polearm/Sword, and a hand axe is Axe/Knife. Combat averages the complete leaf
checks by these weights. Knife is the short-weapon category, not a literal item
name test.

## Condition and repair

Weapons, shields, armor, and clothing are individual inventory instances. Their
condition is a continuous five-bin bar: tier one is yellow-green, tier two
yellow, tier three orange, tier four red, and tier five violet. Bins one and two
are field-repairable, while bins three through five require a settlement
craftsperson. Repairing bin *n* requires Smithing skill *n* for weapons,
shields, and armor, or Tailoring skill *n* for clothing; field work is capped at
bin two. Equipment quality is also its required maintenance skill, so a lesser
smith can improve a masterwork item without restoring it completely. Damage can
never occupy a tier above the item's quality: only quality-5 equipment can
acquire violet tier-5 damage.

Clothing condition and Tailor repair are authoritative for damaged clothing
instances, including seeded and imported damage. Clothing uses the same
equipment protection projection as armor, so padding, resistance, coverage,
flexibility, and range of motion are available to combat and future survival
systems. Carried inventory is deliberately not worn down as if it were being
worn.

## Weather exposure

Strategic survival reuses authored equipment values instead of adding another
set of item statistics. Covered padding supplies insulation. For rain and wind,
the deterministic outermost layer contributes its covered fraction on each
body region. Resistance scales that fraction up to the named
leather-equivalent value and is capped there, so resistance beyond leather
adds no further weatherproofing. Padding also traps moisture
and slows evaporation in warm conditions. These are strategic projections of
the normalized equipment graph, not new equipment slots or tactical tick state.

Quality uses the same 1--5 scale and is shown by the item name using the
corresponding condition color, adjusted toward the fixed light interface text
color for readability. Quality 3 is ordinary munition-grade work, quality 4 is
the sort of commission a knight might order, and quality 5 is work for royalty
or an esteemed hero. Munition grade is the neutral durability baseline. Quality
1--5 multiplies physical durability by 0.65, 0.80, 1.00, 1.25, and 1.60
respectively: the multiplier raises yield and fracture stress and inversely
scales ordinary wear. Outside durability and its maintenance requirements,
quality does not currently change combat statistics, coverage, handling, price,
or any other item property.

The local catalog assigns several starter and demo items across all five
qualities so the Wounded Demo fixture exercises each color and repair ceiling.

Equippable personal-inventory rows expose a compact slot-key control. Equipped
items show every applicable QWERTY key, with lighter text toward the surface and
darker text underneath. Clicking an equipped control unequips it directly.
Clicking an unequipped control opens a self-explanatory keyboard-shaped slot map
with a compact X close control. Invalid locations are dimmed and flash red when
their key is pressed. Eligible occupied locations show the current item's icon;
selecting one atomically unequips that occupant and equips the new item.
Eligible empty locations retain the same icon-sized negative space. Clicking or
pressing a valid key chooses the outermost compatible authored placement or
attachment target. Hovering or keyboard-focusing any equippable control previews
the same map without a modal backdrop. While merely hovering, a mapped key
equips or reassigns the item immediately. Keyboard focus preserves normal Tab
navigation; Space opens the modal before slot keys become active, and Escape
closes it. Clicking an equipped control still unequips it directly. An equipped
item's current placement is highlighted and shows that item's icon in both the
preview and modal maps. Equipped controls name their occupied locations and
protection coverage to assistive technology and in their tooltip. An attached
item's row names its parent and attachment point directly. Swaps validate the
complete destination and every displaced item before changing the graph;
descendant targets and incompatible attachment points remain excluded or are
reported exactly. Non-equipment rows keep a disabled slot control.

Medication reuses the same familiar checkbox gesture without occupying an
equipment slot. Checking it administers and consumes the quantity-one
preparation as a standard course; it cannot be unchecked after administration.
The checkbox is labeled as administering the preparation rather than equipping
it, and is disabled when inspecting a companion because administration through
this gesture is self-only. Direct member transfers and party-pool
deposits/withdrawals preserve every preparation as an individual quantity-one
course. Ordinary equipment behavior is unchanged.

Smithing uses the shared trained-skill curve: 5,000 invested hours is rank 2.5.
Database upgrades split any legacy durable stack into quantity-one instances
while retaining the original row ID for one piece, preserving equipped
references; pooled party equipment is migrated the same way.

Rest resolves health first, then automatic field maintenance, then scheduled
downtime. Field maintenance uses Tailoring for clothing and Smithing for other
durable equipment. Settlement rest recommendations also include unfinished local
repair orders. Services have independently seeded Weaponsmith, Armourer, and
Tailor ratings of 3--5. Repair orders escrow the exact item instance, have an
ETA, retain damage beyond the smith's skill, and never expire. A job's stable
quote is `ceil(base_value * repairable_damage)`, with a minimum of one gold;
only bins within that smith's skill contribute. The quote is charged atomically
from personal gold when the repaired item is retrieved. Bulk collection is
deterministic: orders are considered by submission time and ID, and the
affordable prefix is retrieved without skipping an earlier unaffordable job.
Submitting an equipped item snapshots its stable placement and every parent
edge. Retrieval restores that exact graph atomically; if a saved parent or
capacity is unavailable, retrieval fails without consuming payment or releasing
the escrowed item.

Impact damage uses each item's explicit yield, fracture, wear, and failure-share
values. Ductile armor yields and dents readily but resists catastrophic
fracture; stiff weapons resist ordinary wear but fail more sharply under a
sufficiently large impact. Failure share models construction: one failed plate
in segmented armor contributes less total damage than failure of a monolithic
breastplate. Wear continuously reduces weapon precision and armor/shield
handling, without reducing coverage for the sake of a single local hole.

Weights are kilograms. The documented object weights below anchor the scale;
the other weights are bounded gameplay estimates for ordinary serviceable
examples, rather than claimed measurements of a particular surviving object.
`base_value` is a relative gameplay value that represents material and skilled
labor. It is not a historical price series.

Combat-facing fields retain the meanings in [Combat](../tactical/combat.md):

- `accuracy` is the weapon precision multiplier; values use the documented
  0.5 club/hammer, 1.0 axe, 1.5 sword/spear, and 2.0 purpose-built precision
  calibration.
- `penetration` is its armor-resistance coefficient; blunt weapons use 0.1--0.5,
  ordinary edged weapons 1.0, spear and broadhead-like points 2.0, and narrow
  armor-seeking points 4.0.
- `reach` is metres. The present schema uses it for melee reach on melee items
  and autoresolve range on ranged items.
- `resistance` and `padding` are joules; `coverage`, `flexibility`, and
  `range_of_motion` are 0--1. Plate favors resistance and coverage, mail loses
  resistance under penetrating attacks through its high flexibility, and padded
  clothing favors padding and mobility.

These are deterministic gameplay inferences from the documented combat model
and physical construction, not claims that period sources supplied those exact
numbers. The catalog test rejects duplicate IDs, placeholder `bot_` entries,
impossible slots, absent damage types, out-of-range armor values, and a
weapons-to-armor ratio contrary to the intended inventory.
