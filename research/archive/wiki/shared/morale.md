Morale is a signed strategic stat. Zero is emotionally neutral. Negative morale
creates fear incapacitation, while surplus morale above zero lets a character
with Command lift the spirits of allies who are below zero.

Witness conversations reuse the relationship and morale resolution curve used
by party social actions. Affinity, familiarity, diagnosis quality, approach
risk, and private personality fit all affect an attempt. Quest disclosure is a
separate consequence: a successful approach can release bound testimony, while
a benign concern yields only clarification. This separation prevents morale or
affinity results from becoming a hidden-truth oracle.

The character-sheet morale meter is informational. Its conversation icon opens
the selected character's **Recent Tidings** in the shared Conversation Dock,
with observer-specific morale sources, beliefs, and available social actions.
The privacy
boundary remains the active observer's beliefs rather than authoritative
personality state. Manual response buttons show a response-specific icon and
short label; hovering the icon explains the contextual approach, skill, and
risk. Every manual response spends five strategic minutes. Automatic responses
occur within already-consumed downtime and do not advance the clock again.

Companion responses also include **Pray** for defeat, injury, fatigue, hunger,
and faith concerns, but not filth. Prayer uses the companion's authoritative
professed tradition and the actor's effective Religion knowledge for that
exact tradition. At least some direct study of the tradition is required before
correlated knowledge contributes; the actor need not profess it. Zealous actors
will not lead another character's prayer, so the action remains visible but
disabled. Target Conviction changes prayer fit: Zealous targets respond more
strongly to a successful prayer but are more sensitive to a poor one, while
Irreverent targets are harder and riskier to reach. The prayer catalog shares
mechanical topic profiles while supplying Catholic, Lutheran, Reformed,
Anglican, Orthodox, Islamic, and Jewish devotional language. Opt-in automatic
social care considers Prayer alongside the other eligible approaches using the
same target-specific check, personality fit, cooldown, and authoritative
resolver.

Companion responses also include **Reassure** for injury or pain, fatigue, and
hunger or thirst concerns. The action uses the actor's Physiology check after
shared-language scaling. Its closed, topic-specific bedside catalog is
deliberately conservative: injury reassurance is the strongest of the three,
fatigue is weaker, and hunger or thirst is materially weakest. All three offer
less morale reward and less risk than the relevant specialist or riskier social
approaches; they are not claimed to be safer than simply listening.

Reassurance consists only of honest attention to what the patient reports and
what is plainly observable. It makes no diagnosis, prognosis, triage decision,
humoral claim, or prescription. It changes morale and relationship state only,
never wounds, disease, needs, medication, or any other physical state. It uses
the same five-minute manual cost, target-specific cooldown, durable interaction
history, compact successful-address state, affinity rules, privacy boundary,
and opt-in automatic-care pipeline as other companion responses. Reassurance
does not reveal personality beliefs.

Living, co-located companions show an observer-specific Party Rail badge for
each current actionable negative source row that this character has not yet
successfully addressed. Separate sources count separately even when they share
a topic. Failed attempts, another actor's successes, and successes for another
target do not clear the badge. Selecting a notified portrait or its badge opens
that companion's Social dialog directly; the hover actions retain personal
inspection.

Successful addresses are kept as a compact actor-target-source projection only
while that exact morale source remains current. The durable interaction log
still retains both successes and failures for history, but routine Party Rail
reads never replay that append-only history.

# Morale sources

Every current morale effect is retained as a named signed source for the UI.
Positive and negative sources are ranked separately by absolute magnitude. The
strongest source on each side contributes fully, the second contributes one
half, the third one third, and so on. Will mitigates only the ranked negative
contributions:

```rs
positive_contribution = positive_source / positive_rank;
negative_contribution = negative_source / negative_rank / will_check.max(0.25);
base_morale = sum(positive_contributions) - sum(negative_contributions);
```

The current strategic sources are:

- Injuries.
- Recent victories and setbacks, which decay linearly over seven days of the
  affected character's strategic time.
- The difference between allied and enemy power at a quest location. Undead use
  a 1.5 fear multiplier and demons use 3.0; other enemies use 1.0.
- Religious conviction and mixed-faith discord.
- Morale restored by individual allies.
- Standing cleanliness: Neutral characters moderately dislike filth; Slovenly
  characters ignore it; Cleanly characters suffer a severe scaling penalty and
  receive a modest benefit while completely clean.
- Mastery enjoyment: effective training rejected at any skill's governing
  aptitude cap feeds one shared cross-skill source. It approaches a four-point
  limit with a 40-hour e-fold scale. All rejected gains in one logical clock
  interval are combined before saturation. Existing enjoyment decays linearly
  through that interval before the combined award refreshes it at the endpoint,
  and reaches zero after seven days without another award. Changing skills does
  not reset or multiply the saturation.

Food quality and disease will become additional named sources when those systems
are implemented. **Comfort-seeking/Ascetic** is a good follow-up personality
axis only after food and lodging distinguish quality levels, so it has
meaningful conditions to react to.

# Personality reactions

Personality stores thirteen private, mutable behavioral scores. Each is a
bounded signed fixed-point value from -10,000 to 10,000. The existing nine are
joined by **Merry/Grave**, **Amorous/Proper**, **Open/Guarded**, and
**Introspective/Self-deceiving**. Generated profiles still activate exactly two
to four visible non-neutral behavioral axes by initializing those scores at
their endpoints; every other score begins at zero. Presentation and Inclination
are always assigned and do not count toward sparsity. Conscience is present but
has no morale hook until outcomes carry durable moral context.

Alcohol preference is evaluated for every absolute nightly rest opportunity:
the sleep window begins at 18:00 and continues through 08:00, so a rest that
starts after 18:00 still processes that evening. Temperate characters neither
seek alcohol nor react to its absence.
Neutral characters seek 15 ml pure ethanol on ordinary evenings and 45 ml on
the first evening without another qualifying heavy evening in the prior seven
days; satisfaction grants +1 or +3 morale and failure gives -1 or -3. Drunkards
seek 45 ml every evening, gaining +5 when satisfied and -5 when unsatisfied.
Those are the neutral and endpoint balancing values. The actual nightly morale
magnitude interpolates continuously from neutral at score zero toward zero at
the Temperate endpoint or +/-5 at the Drunkard endpoint; seeking and consumption
still use the visible discrete preference. A durable per-character/evening row
records consumed ethanol and whether morale was evaluated, so long rests,
short-rest sequences, departure clock synchronization, and emergency drinking
cannot duplicate an evening. The latest result replaces one refreshable
alcohol morale source at that evening's absolute 18:00 timestamp; nightly
bonuses and penalties therefore age correctly and never accumulate as an
unbounded series. This is preference, not physiological dependence.

Carousing remains a social leisure activity and Charm-training allocation.
Its existing schedule effect is not interpreted as an additional inventory-
backed alcohol reward; the nightly alcohol event is the only alcohol-specific
morale source.

Reactions modify each raw source before positive/negative ranking and Will
mitigation. Zero score is a 1.0 multiplier; potency interpolates monotonically
to the former discrete multiplier at either endpoint. Thus the old Brave,
Fearful, Ambitious, Content, Sanguine, Brooding, Proud, Humble, Zealous,
Irreverent, Gregarious, and Solitary endpoint balance remains unchanged while
deeds can alter their potency continuously. The browser receives only a
derived label once a score crosses the +/-5,000 visibility threshold. Conscience
uses Compassionate at +5,000, Callous from -5,000 through -7,999, and Cruel at
-8,000 or below. Tooltips remain qualitative so an exact hidden score cannot
be inferred.

Personality changes what an event means, but true tags are never appended to
public source labels. Will governs coping with ranked negative morale, Command
governs the party restoration budget, Religion governs tradition-specific
knowledge, and Conviction governs personal and cohort ardor.

# Lifting allies

Party Command does not contribute a permanent flat morale source. Instead,
positive-morale party members share one party-wide restoration budget. Command
uses its own social-coverage aggregation rather than the generic party skill
formula. The strongest member supplies the base check. Additional members
provide a rapidly saturating coordination bonus, then help or hinder according
to how far their individual check is above or below the neutral 2.5 baseline:

```rs
let coordination = 1.125 * (1.0 - (1.0 / 3.0).powi(supporter_count));
let support = supporters.map(|check| 0.5 * (check - 2.5)).sum();
let party_command = (best_check + coordination + support).clamp(0.0, 5.0);
```

This produces approximately 4.5 from one character at 4.5, three characters at
3, or a 4 and a 2. Adding large numbers of characters at 1 or 2 lowers the
result once their limited coordination benefit is exhausted.

The party's positive base-morale values are aggregated with the same ranked
diminishing returns. The resulting restoration percentage approaches, but never
reaches, a limit of 5% per point of the aggregate party Command check:

```rs
let party_command = aggregate_party_command(member_command_checks);
let party_surplus = cumulative_morale(member_positive_base_morale);
let saturation = 1.0 - (-party_surplus / 10.0).exp();
let party_restoration = saturation * 0.05 * party_command;
```

Ten aggregated surplus morale reaches about 63% of the party's limit, 20 reaches
about 86%, and 30 reaches about 95%. Party Command is capped at 5, so the shared
restoration limit cannot exceed 25% regardless of party size.

The party budget is divided among positive-morale members in proportion to their
individual surplus, allowing the UI to show who is doing the encouraging without
applying the party bonus more than once. All surplus values are calculated
before receiving help from allies. This makes the relationship acyclic: two
high-morale characters cannot recursively increase one another's output. If
support would restore more than the listener's entire deficit, the named
contributions are reduced proportionally. Ally support can lift a character only
to zero and can never create surplus morale.

# Fear and the morale meter

Within the negative half, successful `social_interaction` morale is shown as a
separate purple striped segment beside the remaining fear. Its size is computed
from the same current, ranked morale-source projection shown in the Social
dialogue, and is capped by the gross current actionable negative contribution.
It is therefore an explanation of the current net morale, like a treated
injury segment, rather than extra morale. Color, striping, and meter text all
identify the segment.

Each negative morale point produces one percentage point of fear incapacitation,
so -100 morale is the meaningful left endpoint of the meter. The center
represents neutral morale. The right side shows the character's allocated share
of the party's current ally-restoration percentage relative to the party's
present `5% × aggregate Command` limit. Selecting the meter opens Recent Tidings
and its source actions. Every current source remains a distinct card. Signed,
accessibly worded strength accompanies a yellow neutral color that moves toward
green for increasingly positive values and toward red for increasingly negative
values. Positive and neutral sources are read-only.

The strategic condition and morale-source tables are refreshable projections.
Durable state includes private personality scores and immutable development
events. Active raw morale sources are reinterpreted using the character's
current disposition whenever the projection refreshes: a later deed therefore
changes how a still-active event is presently appraised. Negative-event expiry
remains authoritative once recorded. Personality development is strategic
state, never tactical tick state. Gameplay systems identify development by an
authoritative source; an exact replay is a no-op and conflicting reuse fails
closed.

Discrete profiles are converted to score authority only at character creation
or an explicitly named fixture/import reset. Ordinary demographic or
single-axis updates project from the existing score row and cannot reconstruct
authority from the lossy visible labels. Canonical character deletion removes
both the score row and that character's development audit events; audit events
are character-owned history rather than permanent world chronicles.

# Religion

A character makes or changes their religious profession by speaking with a
priest at a church. Each settlement currently has one church and one fixed
faith; its priest can convert a character only to that faith. Religion is a
dialogue topic even when the priest also has a quest to discuss, rather than a
service-menu choice. A priest cannot make a character faithless. Characters
renounce their current faith from the Religion entry on their own biography
instead. Large cities may eventually support multiple churches, but that is
outside the current settlement model.

Only a professed Zealous character receives the positive religious-leadership
morale source. Its magnitude comes from the party's aggregate effective Religion
check for that character's own tradition, and any living member may contribute
regardless of profession. Same-profession social pressure instead comes from
personality Conviction: Zealous contributes 5.0, Neutral 2.5, and Irreverent
0.0. A character with no professed religion receives neither this source nor
religious pressure.

For each believer, the other religious cohorts are combined into foreign faith
pressure. Mixed-faith tension is deliberately subtractive: party Command is
subtracted from that pressure, and only the uncovered remainder becomes raw
negative morale. This means capable social leadership can remove discord
entirely rather than merely dividing it down:

```rs
let foreign_pressure = aggregate_party_check(other_cohort_checks).clamp(0.0, 5.0);
let discord = 3.0 * (foreign_pressure - party_command).max(0.0);
```

The resulting `Religious discord` source then receives the same negative-source
ranking and Will mitigation as other morale penalties. A unified party therefore
gets the largest available conviction benefit without discord; a mixed party
retains the conviction of each faith but generally pays a leadership-dependent
cost.

# Fervor

Fervor is a bounded strategic pressure meter, not another morale source. It
shows how close religious conviction is to becoming inflexible behavior.
Individual personality Conviction, the character's same-profession Conviction
cohort, and surplus morale raise pressure; aggregate party Command is subtracted
as restraint. Characters with no professed religion always have zero Fervor.

```rs
let pressure = (individual_conviction + cohort_conviction + positive_morale / 10.0
    - party_command - 2.5).max(0.0);
let fervor = 1.0 - (-pressure / 5.0).exp();
```

The curve lets arbitrarily high pressure approach 100% without reaching it. The
strategic character rail displays this value from Calm through Fervent to
Frenzy.

Daily prayer is an activity in the settlement-downtime schedule rather than a
dialogue-style demand. Its existing saturating morale is multiplied by the
party's tradition-specific Religion check divided by five, then receives the
normal religious personality reaction. It trains direct hours in the professed
tradition at 25% of explicit study speed. Fervor creates a continuous desired
prayer allocation of up to two hours per day. A character without a profession
instead meditates: this gives 25% of the saturating morale independently of
Religion checks and personality religious scaling, and creates no Religion
study, Fervor, or neglect. Scheduled prayer and meditation are not attempted
while traveling.

Sunday remains an explicit demand rather than a random Fervor event. Day 7 and
every seventh calendar day thereafter is Sunday. A professing character with
nonzero Fervor who is at a settlement receives the choice once that Sunday:

- **Observe:** spend one full day in settlement. The character receives a small
  positive morale event.
- **Do not observe:** keep complete freedom of action. The raw morale penalty is
  `max(0, 8 × Fervor − 1.6 × party Command)`, so both Fervor and Command change
  the result continuously and a Command check of 5 eliminates even the maximum
  penalty.

Any strategic journey that overlaps Sunday counts as choosing not to observe it
and applies exactly the same penalty once per character for that Sunday. This
includes leaving Saturday night and returning Monday morning. A pending Sunday
prompt is resolved as refused on departure, while an already answered Sunday
cannot be charged twice. Demands are choices, not involuntary character actions,
but spending Sunday on the road is itself the party leader's choice.

## A Quarrel at the Gate

The first severe Fervor incident is a single cross-faith settlement scenario.
When a party arrives at a settlement, the highest-Fervor member who follows a
different religion rolls against their current Fervor. On success they insult
the local faith and draw an armed crowd. A character at 20% therefore has a 20%
arrival chance and one at 80% has an 80% chance, with no unlock threshold. Each
party can trigger this incident only once per settlement.

The incident deliberately reuses the quest-location combat flow. Arrival is
interrupted at a zero-distance encounter named **A Quarrel at the Gate**. The
party can:

- Initiate tactical combat using the normal tactical-server request.
- Autoresolve using the normal quest autoresolve damage and battle-result path.
- Open the encounter map and travel away without fighting.

The incident temporarily occupies the party's active-encounter slot while
preserving any real active quest. Winning or leaving restores that quest.
Leaving marks the incident avoided and does not immediately trigger another
incident at the destination reached by that retreat. The same shared encounter
machinery also handles Thievery and Raiding discoveries, although those
activities use their own scenario text and risk formulas. There are no religious
quest-choice demands; quest dialogue consequences for mixed-faith parties remain
future work.
# Social responses

Morale sources are not dialogue memories. Each source has a closed topic such as
defeat, injury, fatigue, hunger, faith, or filth. The character page's The
morale meter opens Recent Tidings where a party member can listen, commiserate,
use humor, rally with Command, offer a deceptive reframe, or flirt. Labels are
generic and grounded in the durable source; the game does not invent incidental
details about a battle or conversation.

Joke and Flirt remain distinct actions even though both use Charm. Actor
personality determines whether those approaches are available: Grave
characters cannot Joke, and Proper characters cannot Flirt. Their reserve has
a compensating benefit when Rallying: Grave and Proper each add 0.35 to the
actor's Command check, stacking to 0.70 when both apply. Merry and Amorous
characters retain the corresponding action, while target personality and
mutual inclination/presentation still determine how well it lands.

Successful realized morale improvement increases the recipient's directional
Affinity toward the actor. Gains diminish near the positive cap. Failure,
exposure, or a boundary-crossing response can lower Affinity. Repeating the same
approach to the same source has a 24-hour target-clock cooldown. Passive party
morale projection uses Command but never creates Affinity.

Command contributed to another party member is multiplied by that pair's best
shared Oral-language coefficient. The same coefficient scales other directed
Social skill checks; self-directed reflection is unaffected.
