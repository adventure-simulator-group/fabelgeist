# Historical summer drought and wetness

Settlement hydroclimate is sourced from the **NOAA Old World Drought Atlas
(OWDA) v1.0**, a tree-ring reconstruction of annual summer Palmer Drought
Severity Index (PDSI) across Europe and the Mediterranean.

Release maintainers run `just init-owda` to download or verify the pinned file
at
`target/world-data-sources/raw/climate/owda.nc`. Preparation is atomic: a
temporary sibling is size- and checksum-verified before replacement. An
adjacent ignored `.owda-source.json` records the version, URL, both DOIs, size,
and checksum. A mismatched existing cache fails closed; use
`python scripts/init_owda.py --force` only to replace it. Override the compiler
path with `--drought-netcdf`. The raw file is never a standard developer input
and is never included in a world-data input bundle. The importer uses a
pure-Rust, read-only NetCDF-4 decoder; no NetCDF/HDF5 native library enters the
shared schema or database module.

## Standard developer input and release derivation

Developers install the reviewed bundle's
`target/world-data-sources/prepared/owda/settlement-profiles-1544.json` and run
the ordinary `just compile-world`. That bounded profile contains exactly one
sorted entry per bundled Viabundus settlement, its selected-year/20-year
summary, and truthful `direct` or `nearest` sampling classification. It contains
neither OWDA coordinates nor annual values.

After auditing the raw file and preparing the matching Viabundus
`.viabundus-source.json` sidecar, a release maintainer produces that
file deterministically with:

```bash
cargo run -p adventuresim-world-import -- \
  --drought-netcdf target/world-data-sources/raw/climate/owda.nc \
  --derive-owda-profiles target/world-data-sources/prepared/owda/settlement-profiles-1544.json
```

The command refuses a missing grid sample rather than emitting a deceptive
profile, generates (or validates) `settlement-ids-1544.json`, hashes both
matching Viabundus records into the output, and is
limited to the reviewed 1544 release. Bundle verification checks those hashes,
the exact settlement-ID coverage, integer bounds, and sampling classification.

## Source boundary

The parser requires the documented `lon=114`, `lat=88`, and `time=2013`
dimensions; monotonically spaced longitude, latitude, and annual time axes;
and an f64 `pdsi(lon, lat, time)` variable with the source long name and units.
It reads the twenty summers ending in the selected world year. A cell must have
all twenty finite, three-decimal values or twenty NaNs denoting no source
coverage. Partial histories, infinities, unexpected precision, changed axis
orientation, and values outside the audited PDSI range fail at the source
boundary.

The downloaded 228 MB file was verified directly. Across the complete dataset,
8,826,343 of 20,194,416 values are finite; values span -11.996 to 13.431 and
have exactly three decimal places. The 1525–1544 window contains 5,414 complete
grid cells with stable coverage.

## Canonical model and sampling

PDSI is stored as a bounded signed integer in thousandths, not a raw float.
Standard thresholds derive extreme, severe, moderate, or mild drought; normal
conditions; and mild through extreme wetness. Each settlement stores:

- its reconstructed 1544 summer PDSI;
- mean PDSI over 1525–1544;
- the number of moderate-or-worse drought summers (PDSI at most -2);
- the number of moderately-or-more wet summers (PDSI at least 2).

The history constructor guarantees that both counts fit the twenty-year window,
cannot sum past it, include the current summer in the correct category, and
admit the stored mean under the bounded drought, normal, and wet value ranges.
Canonical data distinguishes reconstructed profiles from complete inferred
profiles; there is no unknown state.

Sampling first uses the containing half-degree grid point. For a coastal or
otherwise missing cell, it selects the physically nearest reconstructed point,
with longitude distance scaled by latitude, up to 1.5 degrees. A location
beyond that limit receives a neutral inferred profile. An audit of all 6,041
Viabundus settlements active in 1544 produced 5,458 direct samples, 583 nearest
neighbors, and no fallbacks.

The data can directly affect current harvests, seasonal moisture and yields,
water stress and availability, fire risk, forage, river conditions, and travel.
The twenty-year history can inform reserves, prices, migration pressure, and
whether a single dry or wet summer is locally unusual. Selected-year drought
does **not** permanently assign or alter a settlement's biome.

## Attribution and redistribution boundary

The repository and compiled world contain only bounded per-settlement derived
values: selected-year PDSI, twenty-year mean, drought/wet counts, and the
reconstruction/inference classification with concise provenance. They do not
contain source grids, annual series, the complete NetCDF file, journal prose or
figures, or rendered journal/source maps. Reusers should cite both the NOAA
dataset DOI and Cook et al. paper DOI above. The local source cache remains
ignored and must not be committed or redistributed through this repository.
