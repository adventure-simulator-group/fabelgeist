# Tactical automated testing

This covers CLI-driven, headless control of the tactical server/client (the
Bevy Remote Protocol) and the pytest suite built on top of it. It complements
the interactive workflows in [Development workflow](developing.md) -
`tactical-play`, `tactical-isolated`, `tactical`/`client` - which remain the
right tool for anything a human needs to watch happen.

## Bevy Remote Protocol (BRP)

Both `adventuresim-tactical-server` and `adventuresim-tactical-client` can
expose a JSON-RPC-over-HTTP endpoint for external inspection and control, gated
behind the `debug` feature and only active when `--brp-port <port>` is passed.
This fork uses `world.*` method names, not upstream Bevy's `bevy/*` - the ones
in active use here are `rpc.discover`, `world.query`, `world.get_components`,
`world.insert_resources`, `world.remove_resources`, `world.spawn_entity`, and
`world.despawn_entity`.

Enable it on a manually-run server or client:

```bash
just tactical brp_port=15702
just client-headless brp_port=15703
```

`ButtonInput<KeyCode>` is not reflect-registered, so keypresses (F7-F12) cannot
be simulated over BRP - drive real windowed/physical input for those, or send
the underlying network message directly (see `DebugDumpWorldRequest` and
similar in `adventuresim-tactical-netcode`).

### `scripts/tactical_brp.py`

A thin JSON-RPC client plus a few helpers, meant to be imported (`import
tactical_brp`) or invoked directly:

- `BrpClient(port)` - `.call(method, params)` for raw JSON-RPC, plus typed
  wrappers around the common `world.*` methods: `.query(with_=[...], ...)`,
  `.get_components(entity, [ComponentType, ...])`, `.insert_resource(instance)`,
  `.remove_resource(ResourceType)`, `.despawn(entity)`. These take/return the
  generated `BevyComponent`/`BevyResource` classes (see below), not raw
  type-path strings or dicts.
- `find_entity_with_component` / `wait_for_entity_with_component` - locate the
  first entity carrying a given component class, with the latter polling up to
  a timeout.
- `python scripts/tactical_brp.py call <port> <method> [--params '{...}']` for
  ad hoc JSON-RPC calls from a shell - this one stays string/dict-based, since
  it's a generic escape hatch for arbitrary methods, not just the typed
  component/resource wrappers.
- `just tactical-brp-smoke-test` - drives an already-running `just tactical
  brp_port=...` + `just client-headless` pair: finds the local player, moves
  it, asserts the position changed.

### Generated types: `BevyComponent`/`BevyResource`

BRP identifies types by their exact Rust `TypePath::type_path()` string (e.g.
`"adventuresim_tactical_core::player::CharacterId"`). Hand-copying these into
Python is fragile - nothing catches a type getting renamed or moved to a
different module, and `tactical_brp.py` would just silently query for a type
path that no longer resolves to anything.

`just generate-brp-types` regenerates `scripts/adventuresim_brp_lib.py`, which
`tactical_brp.py` imports (`from adventuresim_brp_lib import *`), by
discovering every BRP-queryable type - anything with `ReflectComponent` or
`ReflectResource` registry data - directly from a real `AppTypeRegistry`:

```bash
just generate-brp-types
```

This is dynamic discovery, not a hand-maintained list: `reflect_auto_register`
(a bevy feature enabled workspace-wide) auto-registers every linked-in
`#[derive(Reflect)]` type the moment any `App` exists, via `inventory` -
`crates/adventuresim-tactical-brp-generator/src/main.rs` just builds a bare
`App::new()` (no plugins added, nothing run) and reads the registry back out.

Two base classes, `BevyComponent` and `BevyResource`, are always emitted
first. Every discovered Component/Resource type becomes its own subclass of
one of them - `CharacterId(BevyComponent)`, `PlayerInputOverride(BevyResource)`,
and so on - carrying `type_path: ClassVar[str]` plus `to_brp()`/`from_brp()`
(see below). `BrpClient`'s methods (`.query()`, `.get_components()`,
`.insert_resource()`, `.remove_resource()`, `find_entity_with_component`, ...)
all take and return these classes, not raw type-path strings - see the
`### scripts/tactical_brp.py` section above. There is no separate flat
`NAME_TYPE = "..."` string constant for anything - `ClassName.type_path` is
the *only* way to get at a type path, deliberately, so nothing in this
project references BRP types by bare string. Classes are grouped into
`# Components`/`# Resources`/`# Nested/helper types` sections (a type
registering as both a Component and a Resource, which doesn't currently
happen, would land in `# Components`). If two types share a short name, the
class name gets a `1`/`2`/... disambiguating suffix.

For the generator binary to see `adventuresim-tactical-server`'s and
`-client`'s otherwise-private types (e.g. `bot::MissionEnemy`,
`player::ClientPlayer` - both `mod`, not `pub mod`, in their respective
`main.rs`), each crate carries a `[lib]` target (`src/lib.rs`) that re-declares
just enough of its module tree as `pub`. That target is gated behind a
`remote-types` feature, off by default and not implied by `debug` - a normal
`cargo build`/`check` of either package (which always builds every target,
lib included) does not pay to compile that module tree a second time; only
`--features remote-types` does.

Regenerate after adding, renaming, or moving a `#[reflect(Component)]`/
`#[reflect(Resource)]` type. This has already caught a real gap:
`EquipmentTopology`
(`adventuresim-tactical-core/src/inventory.rs`) derives `Reflect` but is
missing `#[reflect(Component)]`, so despite looking reflect-registered it is
not actually BRP-queryable - a hand-typed constant for it would have looked
correct and silently returned nothing at query time.

### `to_brp()`/`from_brp()`

Every generated class - a `BevyComponent`/`BevyResource` subclass, or one of
the plain nested helper dataclasses reachable through their fields (e.g.
`PlayerInputRequest` is a field of `PlayerInputOverride`) - has a `to_brp()`
method producing the exact value BRP expects on the wire, and a `from_brp()`
classmethod doing the reverse (used by `get_components()`'s return value).
This is what "autocompletion/type-verification for tactical tests" means in
practice:

```python
tactical_client.insert_resource(
    tactical_brp.PlayerInputOverride(
        value=tactical_brp.PlayerInputRequest(movement=[0.0, 1.0], look=[0.0, 0.0], jump=False, weapon_guard="Lowered")
    )
)
transform = tactical_client.get_components(entity, [tactical_brp.Transform])[tactical_brp.Transform]
print(transform.translation)
```

`weapon_guard` above is typed `Literal["Lowered", "Raised"]`, not `str` - a
type checker (or an IDE's inline diagnostics) flags a typo'd variant name
before the test ever runs.

Resolution (`crates/adventuresim-tactical-brp-generator/src/resolve.rs`) walks
each field's reflected `TypeInfo` recursively, but the reflected *shape*
of a type is not always its wire *encoding* - bevy's reflect serializer
special-cases some shapes, and the resolver has to know about each one rather
than assume the naive translation:

- A single-field tuple struct (`CharacterId(u64)`) is transparent on the wire
  - its value *is* the inner value, not a one-element array. As a *field* of
    some other type this inlines directly (no wrapper class at all); as a
    top-level Component/Resource it still gets a class (`CharacterId`, with a
    single `value: int` field) purely so the BrpClient API has a uniform
    class to work with, but `to_brp()` returns the bare `int`, not `{"value":
    ...}`.
- `Option<T>` is `None` or a bare `T`, not `{"Some": ...}`.
- A small set of `glam` types
  (`Vec2`/`Vec3`/`Vec3A`/`Vec4`/`Quat`/`IVec*`/
  `UVec*`) have a custom `Serialize` impl the reflected shape can't see at
  all - hardcoded to their known `list[float]`/`list[int]` wire shape rather
  than resolved generically.
- A unit-only enum (all variants carry no data, e.g. `EquipSlot`) becomes a
  `Literal[...]` of its variant names, matching the bare-string wire value.

Anything else the resolver doesn't confidently know how to encode - a
data-carrying enum (`ArmorItem.slot: ArmorSlot`, whose `Arms`/`Legs` variants
carry a nested `Option<ArmorSide>`), a `Map`, a `Set` - resolves to `Any` with
an `# unresolved: <type path>` comment rather than a guess. A generated
constructor that *looks* right but silently sends BRP a malformed payload
would be worse than no constructor at all, so an unresolved field is left
visibly unresolved: pass a raw dict/value shaped to match that type's own BRP
encoding for those.

## End-to-end pytest suite

`scripts/tests/tactical/` spawns real subprocesses - an isolated SpacetimeDB
instance, the tactical server, one or more headless tactical clients - and
drives them over BRP. This is meaningfully slower than the rest of
`scripts/tests/` (real compile/bootstrap cost: single-digit minutes on a warm
`target/` cache, much longer cold), so it is not part of the default `test`
recipe:

```bash
just tactical-test            # every test in scripts/tests/tactical
just tactical-test movement   # pytest -k filter on name substring
```

Layout:

- **`lib.py`** - process-spawning primitives shared by everything else:
  `SpawnedProcess` (background `just` recipe or direct `cargo run`, killed by
  process group on teardown), `spawn()`, `wait_for()` (polls a readiness
  check, fails fast if the process exits early, includes the log tail on
  timeout), `report_phase()`, `read_env_file()`, plus `REPO_ROOT`/`ENV_FILE`
  and the shared timeouts.
- **`conftest.py`** - the session-scoped fixtures most tests build on:
  `tactical_mission` (`just tactical-isolated`, default profile/ports),
  `tactical_server` (`just tactical`, depends on `tactical_mission`),
  `tactical_client` (`just client-headless`, depends on `tactical_server`,
  waits for a `ClientPlayer` entity to appear - i.e. the client has joined).
  Also a `pytest_collection_modifyitems` hook forcing `test_lifecycle.py` to
  collect last: it ties up the machine for a minute-plus building/tearing down
  its own isolated instance, and running that in between the shared fixtures'
  setup and `test_movement.py`'s tight movement-detection window left the
  idling shared client too starved to pass.
- **`test_connectivity.py`** - BRP reachability and player-entity-exists
  smoke tests, using the shared fixtures.
- **`test_movement.py`** - drives `PlayerInputOverride` and asserts the local
  player's `Transform` actually moves.
- **`test_lifecycle.py`** - self-contained (its own profile, ports, and
  `.env.tactical` write, not the shared fixtures), covering the
  join/despawn/disconnect character-count lifecycle. Runs with
  `--enemy-combat-scale-bps 0` so bots stay inert instead of ending the
  mission mid-test. See its own comments for why it can't use the `tactical`
  recipe for its server launch.
- **`test_combat_defense.py`** - self-contained combat tests exercising the
  bot parry/dodge mechanic end to end: standalone `--world-dump` server (no
  SpacetimeDB), a real headless client, a real melee attack (via
  `bevy_enhanced_input`'s `ActionMock`, not a debug bypass), and BRP mutation
  of the bot's `DefenseChances` to force deterministic dodge/parry outcomes.
  Uses a hand-calibrated world-dump fixture (`fixtures/combat_scenario.scn.ron`)
  so the bot's skills/attributes actually allow it to dodge. See its own
  comments for the more fiddly details (facing setup, outcome detection,
  port isolation between scenarios).

`.env.tactical` (written by `tactical-isolated`/`reseed-tactical-mission`) is
deleted on orderly shutdown - now including `SIGTERM`, not just `Ctrl+C`/
`SIGINT` (see `scripts/dev_stack.py::main`), so a `just`-recipe or pytest
fixture teardown cleans it up the same way an interactive `Ctrl+C` always did.
