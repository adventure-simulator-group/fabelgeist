# Strategic NPC simulation

Provision scenarios use multiple food definitions and aggregate useful calories
across independent lots. Drivers must not assume all food is `travel_ration`.

`adventuresim-strategic-sim` is a native, deterministic experiment harness for
balance exploration and regression reproduction. It has two deliberately
different backends: a fast native settlement-activity model for multi-year
population sweeps, and an opt-in reducer-backed core-loop driver for behavioral
and integration testing.

## Reproducibility contract

Configuration, manifests, profiles, traces, snapshots, and reports are
versioned JSON. Unknown configuration fields are rejected and population,
duration, decisions, trace events, and snapshots are bounded. The profile
generator uses the repository-owned SplitMix64 implementation and a stable
sub-seed per agent. Generation and simulation never depend on hash-map
iteration order or `DefaultHasher`. Reports use ascending agent ID within each
ascending day. Changing the random algorithm, field interpretation, or
canonical ordering requires a format-version bump.

The canonical BLAKE3 digest covers the manifest and all canonical report data;
the digest field itself is blanked before hashing. `replay` reruns the recorded
manifest and verifies both the stored report and reproduced digest. There is no
performance or wall-clock metadata in the canonical report. Reproducibility is
guaranteed for the same simulator format. Canonical hashing quantizes floating
values to four decimal places so harmless JSON and cross-platform subprecision
differences do not change the digest; stored balance metrics retain their full
precision. A future fixed-point game-state migration can strengthen guarantees
beyond that explicit tolerance. Config and report inputs are streamed with a 64
MiB limit, and their vector bounds are revalidated before hashing or replay.

Daily scheduling is intentional and represents repeated one-day player actions.
It gives future incident policies a single canonical decision granularity. Pure
schedule training and settlement activity calculations live in
`adventuresim-core`; both the SpacetimeDB module and simulator call those same
functions. The live reducer's bulk rest currently trains and then evaluates one
aggregate activity interval; rounded income and single incident interruption can
therefore differ from repeated one-day actions. Bulk-rest strategy testing is
follow-up work rather than part of this first-slice contract. Gold from labor
and thievery is an intentional economic source. Future purchases, provisions,
lodging, and losses will be explicit sinks; the runner therefore does not assert
naive currency conservation.

## Profiles and results

Simulator-authored schedules currently allocate zero Reading minutes, keeping
existing policy behavior stable. Camp and travel policy explicitly mask the
player-facing Reading allocation.

Profiles retain their seed and all inputs needed for inspection: a deterministic
sparse personality (two through four non-neutral axes across thirteen behavioral
axes), plus always-assigned Sex, Presentation, and Inclination; correlated,
bounded attributes; an explicit personality-by-attribute build role; initial
leaf skills; activity allocations that produce training; activity-versus-quest,
risk, and recovery preferences; equipment style and utility weights; and
provisioning, reserve, and spending preferences. Some fields are recorded for
later slices and do not yet affect settlement choices. Build derivation keeps
skills, training, activity, quest risk/recovery, and equipment style coherent.
Content leaders are activity-only; ambition increases quest propensity. Bravery
selects heavy front-line melee only when endurance and both-arm strength make it
viable, while fearful agents prefer ranged/light roles when their perception
supports one. Followers still defer to the current leader's quest/activity
decision; individual follower policy is applied to training, recovery,
treatment, and equipment, which is a known party-decision limitation. Bootstrap
distributes build roles deterministically across bounded party groups, then
selects the lowest-ID non-Content member in each group as its founding leader
when one exists. An all-Content group remains activity-only. Ordinary party
reducers remain authoritative for joining and later leadership succession.

Reports include a bounded decision trace, bounded periodic snapshots, terminal
reason, wealth, final and gained skill hours, activity and leisure time,
settlement-aware Infamy, and cumulative risk exposure. Reports also contain the
typed Pareto frontier that maximizes wealth and skill-hour gain while minimizing
Infamy and risk exposure; the human summary prints its stable agent IDs. Risk
exposure is a metric, not a fake combat or incident outcome. Pareto utilities
require typed maximize/minimize objectives, preserve exact ties, and reject
nonfinite values. The `matched` command holds a profile and seed constant while
changing only its declared labor/thievery activity preference and allocation.

## Authoritative core-loop backend

`StrategicBackend` separates observations and player-like intents from native
state mutation. `NativeSettlementBackend` remains the fast deterministic
backend. The `core-loop` command instead connects through generated typed SDK
bindings and serializes ordinary reducer calls, waiting for both reducer
completion and the subscribed state that follows it. It creates several
independent parties through ordinary join request/accept reducers. Each leader
then independently chooses settlement activity or questing from its generated
policy until its in-game duration or cycle bound is reached. Before an outbound
case-site leg, the evaluator derives a conservative public provisioning horizon
from disclosed distance and walking schedule. Four times the ordinary daylight
elapsed projection covers fatigue-expanded outbound travel plus the return leg;
a further one-day reserve covers delays and encounters. It forecasts food and
water for the living party from public needs and inventory and buys an
affordable shortfall through the ordinary merchant reducer. A co-located living
party member may pay using the shared treasury plus their purse, while retaining
their observable medical reserve. Pricing fails closed without that payer's
public local-price effect and exactly one public default merchant present at
that payer's own public character time. If either staple is unavailable or
unaffordable, the party remains at the settlement and performs sustainable
activity instead of knowingly departing empty. Questing then travels through
persisted camp stops, autoresolves, stores loot, returns, turns in, liquidates
party loot, withdraws the member's earned stake, purchases from the merchant,
and equips an upgrade. Followers travel and run their own daily schedules.
Defeat causes a retreat, bounded settlement convalescence, and abandonment of
the direct contract; the driver never gambles on a new autoresolve roll against
an unchanged threat. A generated-case finale records a bounded fingerprint made
only from subscribed public party capability rows and will not reattempt the
same defeated threat until that fingerprint materially changes.

Direct contracts are eligible only when a conservative public matchup estimate
accepts them. The estimate combines disclosed difficulty and an exact,
allowlisted interpretation of the public opposition-count wording with living,
ready members' public combat capabilities. It mirrors the authoritative enemy
base-rating curve and requires a 25 percent party-power margin; unknown count
wording fails closed. Risk tolerance ranks only the eligible set. Accepted
contracts are revalidated before continuation and again after travel; an unsafe
deterioration causes retreat and abandonment, while `ReadyToReport` contracts
remain turn-in eligible. When offered contracts exist but none is safe, the
trace records `no_safe_contract` and the party uses generated discovery or
settlement activity instead. Hidden hostile authority is never a policy input.

Core-loop reports are explicitly tagged `spacetimedb_authoritative_core_loop`
and retain the server origin, disposable database, claimed run nonce, generated
profiles, semantic action trace, final equipment and capabilities, and metrics
for quest results, activity days, camps, loot value, proceeds, earned stake
withdrawals, purchases, upgrades, unexpected reducer failures/retries, stuck
detection, and duplicate semantic events. Final agent rows distinguish the
legacy character gold field, personal gold-coin stacks, party treasury, and
party stake. They also expose the public settlement or exact case-site
occupancy, active public journey destination, and symptomatic/critical flags, so
`ready` does not conceal illness and a remote party is not mistaken for a
stranded journey. Generated preferences drive quest/activity choice, quest risk,
and weighted equipment utility (protection, mobility, price, and reach) for
unarmored, light, heavy, and ranged styles. An upgrade counts only after the
authoritative equipment row shows the purchased inventory item.

Each autonomous party choice records an observer-safe `quest_decision` before
the selected action. It includes the deterministic policy selector and quest
propensity, current settlement, count of player-visible offered contracts,
the leader's count of open generated cases and projected investigation actions,
and the selected direct-contract, generated-discovery, generated-case, or
activity path. An owned open generated case takes precedence over the random
activity selector. Repeated daily decisions
are intentionally exempt from semantic-duplicate alarms. Because this evaluator
does not open tactical crime incidents, authored Thievery and Raiding schedule
minutes are explicitly reassigned to legal Labor in the effective schedule
instead of disappearing into leisure; the authored preference remains intact.
When a non-earning schedule such as Prayer meets low-food reserve pressure, its
preferred allocation temporarily becomes legal Labor with
`subsistence_reserve_to_labor`; the authored preference is restored when the
pressure clears. The chosen effective schedule is installed and verified
before the ordinary rest reducer runs. Temple viability requires one visible
day of food only because settlement water is authoritative and free. Otherwise
the policy selects a full-board Inn only when the purse covers its public cost
plus observable medical commitments and as much of the profile's visible cash
reserve target as is currently attainable. A Temple remains the player-visible
last resort while initial Labor builds that reserve. Activity events retain
the preferred and effective activity, installed schedule, venue, committed
reserve, fallback reason, and public pre/post purse, strategic condition,
hunger, thirst, visible food and water, character minutes, and signed deltas,
with `outcome=completed`. A rejected settlement-rest attempt
instead emits one `outcome=failed` activity event before the run stops,
containing its public pre-action state, effective plan and venue, stable stage,
and safe error category without raw reducer text. Random encounters use a
deterministic safety floor over the server-projected choices: detour when it is
offered, then an eligible run, then bandit surrender, and attack only when no
protective response exists. Evacuation never attacks. The encounter event
records the stable reason, evacuation flag, public run eligibility, and
projected choice set.

Absolute character clocks are sampled after bootstrap and all duration gates and
final elapsed-time fields use monotonic deltas from that baseline. A fresh run
in a mature world therefore receives its configured duration instead of being
mistaken for a run that already exhausted it. For narrative road challenges,
public available choice IDs are joined to the public authored catalog. The
policy may select a uniquely identified, check-free, non-combat route only when
it positively aligns with the leader's personality. Public requirements and
availability are legality gates, not evidence that spending resources is
desirable. Checked and combat-starting routes are rejected; the catalog's
unconditional unchecked `ignore` remains the fallback. Telemetry records the
visible alternatives, conservative meaningful candidates, and selection reason.

Generated investigation actions are ranked by a stable pure score. It considers
projected availability and progress (perform, travel, or bounded wait), the
owner profile's fit for the projected method, public uncertainty, public
duration, and public wait. `action_id` is only the final tie-break. The policy
reads no canonical generated-case rows or private hostile authority. Its
skill-fit mirror uses Insight for inspect, search, locate, watch, patrol, and
approach; averages Insight and Stealth for ambush; and gives tracking no claimed
fit because the public projection does not disclose the governing terrain. After
a generated-finale defeat, an unchanged owner/case public combat fingerprint
suppresses the case before any further provisioning or travel, with the same
guard retained at the site.

Camp handling subscribes only
to the public `party_journey` and `party_journey_itinerary` projections. At
each stop it applies the same remaining-interval overlap as the web UI to
`completed_elapsed_minutes..total_elapsed_minutes`, rests exactly to the end of
the active forecast camp through `rest_at_camp`, logs bounded pre/post public
camp state, and re-reads the journey, itinerary, party, health, and leader
before `continue_camp_travel`. A missing, overlapping, or non-advancing
projection fails closed instead of guessing a fixed rest duration. Camp
coherence failures distinguish zero active forecast intervals from overlapping
intervals and include bounded public elapsed totals and forecast counts.
The travel driver returns an explicit `Completed`,
`HeldNoActionableActor`, or `HeldForRecovery` outcome. A hold is nonfatal:
the current quest, return, or turn-in step stops without claiming arrival,
marking a case site traveled, or substituting an incapacitated leader.
Before ordinary quest selection on each in-budget cycle, the runner continues
any active public journey. After a completed leg it revalidates the current
leader, owner, party health, and exact public settlement or case-site
occupancy. An open generated owner case then resumes at its arrived site.
A direct contract resumes from the party's public `active_contract_id`, public
party ownership, and `Accepted` or `ReadyToReport` contract status rather than
searching only offered contracts. Resumption does not increment contract
attempt metrics again. Reporting is attempted only after public state proves
arrival at the contract's origin settlement; the ready-to-report status gate
prevents duplicate completion metrics.
The public resident-presence projection is a useful fast check, but the
interaction reducer remains authoritative because NPC availability is rebuilt
at the actor's exact clock. An exact authoritative "issuer unavailable"
rejection therefore produces a bounded `contract_issuer_unavailable` deferral
with `authoritative_interaction_rejection` provenance for both acceptance and
reporting. It does not count a reducer failure, contract attempt, or completion,
and the offered or ready-to-report contract is retried later. Every other
interaction rejection remains fatal and is counted normally.

A healthy party that an authoritative activity incident leaves idle at an
exact case site returns through the ordinary travel reducer and persisted camp
loop before the simulator schedules more settlement downtime. This fallback
does not interrupt a persisted journey, accepted direct contract, or unresolved
generated case. It requires exactly one origin settlement across the party's
owner-scoped pins, a ready living party, concrete food and water for one field
day, safe current load/equipment/thermal state, and a safe public return-route
forecast. The sole supply exception is an exact observed, unpinned activity
incident relocation whose authority site is at the origin settlement: that
same-settlement departure is zero-distance, so it bypasses field-journey food,
water, load, equipment, current thermal-strain, and route-forecast gates. It
still requires a living all-ready party, a current leader, exact observed
party/site/origin provenance, and successful ordinary reducer validation.
Pinned and generated sites retain the full reserve, readiness, and forecast
rules. Distinct hold reasons identify condition, supplies, departure readiness,
origin, actor, forecast, and incomplete arrival failures rather than collapsing
them into a misleading supply failure. Missing, ambiguous, or unsafe evidence
holds instead of guessing or teleporting. Its travel events use
`idle_case_site_return`, separately from health suppression, recovery, and
evacuation metrics.
Some authority-owned activity incidents do not disclose an owner-visible case
site pin. When settlement activity starts at a public settlement and the same
party is observed immediately afterward at an exact case site, the simulator
keeps an ephemeral `(party, site) -> origin settlement` observation. That
observation is a last-resort return provenance only for the exact still-occupied
site, after persisted journeys and unique owner-visible pins; it never parses
private incident IDs or overrides ambiguous pin evidence. It is ignored for a
different site and cleared once the party is observed back at a settlement.
This lets both a healthy party and an incapacitated party start the ordinary
authoritative return journey after a newly introduced activity incident.

Pending authority arrests are handled before either that idle return or health
evacuation. A gateway-only public action projection exposes only an unlinkable
random action capability, the exact party, occupied case site, origin
settlement, living party-member instigator, computed fine, and whether the
party currently has enough currency. It does not expose the source-derived
incident ID, private incident source, offense, severity, hostility, or other
incident authority. The reducer resolves that capability against private
authority and rechecks the character's party membership and exact occupied
site. When exactly one action matches the controlled party and
site, the instigator is still a living controlled party member, and the fine is
affordable, the runner invokes the ordinary `surrender_to_authority` reducer.
It counts `authority_surrenders` and `authority_fines_paid` only after public
state confirms that the exact action disappeared while the party remained at
the exact site. Missing, ambiguous, unaffordable, stale, or unconfirmed actions
hold or fall through to the existing fail-closed recovery/return policy; they
never cause the simulator to inspect private incident rows. After a confirmed
surrender, normal public recovery or travel proceeds, preventing flight and
the resulting avoiding-authority rearrest loop.

Off-settlement health is an explicit expedition state, not a reason to repeat
quest suppression indefinitely. Before selecting another quest action, the
runner reads only public party membership/location, strategic condition, illness
signal, needs, concrete supplies, journey itinerary, and owner-visible case-site
pins. It immediately records a recovery plan and makes at most two one-day
field-rest attempts when pooled concrete stored food and portable water cover
every living member's daily requirement and nobody is critical. Injury or
disease boundaries may clip an attempt, so actual elapsed minutes are measured
rather than assuming a completed day. The expedition resumes only when there is
a living actionable member and every living member is ready and asymptomatic. A
successful field recovery resumes the same bounded policy cycle, allowing an
already-public on-site action to proceed instead of losing the final cycle to
recovery bookkeeping. When recovery began inside the configured duration but its
bounded rests cross the duration threshold, only that same cycle's one public
quest/on-site action is allowed; the next cycle observes the ordinary duration
cutoff. A cycle with no recovery does not cross the cutoff, and the final
bounded rescue pass never selects a quest action. Evacuation or a fail-closed
hold consumes the cycle. Otherwise a ready companion directs an ordinary journey
back to the one public origin settlement. If the leader is unready, reducers
narrowly permit that ready party member to direct off-settlement camp rest,
return-route continuation, and protective (never attack/objective) encounter
choices; this does not transfer leadership or grant contract, combat-objective,
or ordinary quest authority. Evacuation counts as complete only when public
state shows a living party at that settlement with no remaining camp
destination; an incomplete leg is logged as stalled. The recovery loop reselects
a public ready, asymptomatic, noncritical actor before every individual field
rest. If the previous rest leaves nobody actionable, it does not reuse the stale
actor. One narrow passive-recovery mode may still apply when no living member is
publicly actionable. Public symptoms may be the reason even when a member's
condition status is `ready`; every living member must have a known ready,
staggered, or incapacitated status and none may be critical. The authoritative
leader must be alive, the party must be off-settlement at a coherent persisted
journey camp, and concrete pooled supplies must cover the requested day. The
simulator represents this with a separate typed `PassiveNoActionable` rest actor
which can reach only the camp rest call boundary. It cannot continue travel,
resolve an encounter, perform a case action, accept or report a contract, vote
on leadership, or invoke any other reducer. This is passive convalescence—the
state is resting—not action authority.

Passive eligibility and the public member/supply state are recalculated before
each of at most two rest attempts. If any member becomes actionable, the
ordinary ready-actor recovery path takes over; if everyone becomes ready and
asymptomatic, the expedition may resume. A critical member, insufficient
supplies, a dead leader, an unresolved public encounter, or a missing,
ambiguous, mismatched, completed, or forecast-incoherent public camp journey
fails closed to a typed hold before invoking the reducer. Both ordinary and
passive recovery rests use this same public camp predicate: party destination,
unique matching journey and itinerary, incomplete elapsed journey, and a valid
active forecast camp interval.

`expedition_passive_rest_attempts` counts reducer attempts, while
`expedition_passive_rest_minutes` sums the actual public maximum-member clock
delta. The event records requested and actual minutes, so a disease or injury
boundary that clips a request never masquerades as a completed day. The
ordinary public per-member and concrete-supply before/after diagnostics remain
attached to `phase=passive_no_actionable_rest`. The policy never reads private
disease or exposure state.

Every recovery camp and evacuation leg records each member's public before and
after condition, hunger, thirst, food/water days, symptom/critical flags, and
elapsed time. It also records changes in concrete stored food and portable
water. Private disease episodes and exposure are not subscribed; diagnostics
state `exposure=not_publicly_projected` rather than inferring it. Stable reasons
distinguish health suppression, bounded field recovery, safe resumption, and
settlement evacuation. A journey leg may claim that every member is ready only
after its public post-leg member projection proves that condition; otherwise
it explicitly requests off-settlement recovery on the next cycle.
When no living member is actionable, a
`journey_held_no_actionable_actor` diagnostic records only bounded public
evidence: elapsed, total, and remaining journey time; destination; remaining
camp movement; the active public forecast interval when present; living-member
count; one-day food and water requirements; concrete stored food and portable
water; and whether those supplies cover one rest day. The report counts these
and health-driven journey holds in `expedition_holds`. It records the public
strategic thermal/wetness projection but does not expose or infer private
exposure or disease authority.
A held party is tracked separately from a party that performed an action.
A hold with no public character-time progress does not make the cycle active
and cannot by itself advance authoritative world time. If another party acts,
that independent activity may still advance the shared world; a recovery rest
that advanced public party time also counts as real progress even when a later
step holds.

Successful final-agent rows carry the same public needs, visible food and water,
remote location, journey destination, illness flags, settlement services,
herbalist quote, and inn full-board cost used by failure diagnostics. Failure
artifacts use schema version 7. In addition to the strict
event vocabulary and activity-detail semantics, they retain only an allowlisted
operation name and stable reason code for expected investigation and camp
failures. `travel_camps`, `rest_at_camp`, and `continue_camp_travel` are
allowlisted operations with stable held-journey, daylight-window, and
journey-projection reason codes; raw reducer text is never copied into the
artifact. These fields make poverty,
starvation, unavailable-rest, and stale temporal-action deadlocks diagnosable
without exposing hidden case truth.

In full-world runs, leaders without an offered direct contract discover local
generated problems through the same ordinary player dialogue used by the web
client. The runner uses only public settlement-NPC facts and current public
presence. Discovery is discriminated by the public settlement location and
time, not by the source NPC. Each decision performs exactly one ordinary
dialogue with the stably first public representative at the inn when one is
present. The settlement overview is used only when no inn representative is
present, matching the same public discovery rule enforced by the server.
Presence alone is insufficient: an inn row must join to a persistent NPC with
a valid player/NPC dialogue before it suppresses overview fallback. Orphan
presence and unknown or non-dialogue conversations fail closed and are omitted
from the gateway's public contact projection. An unproductive action falls
back to an ordinary settlement activity day before another discovery decision.

After `no_public_rumor_available`, the runner waits two official days before
repeating the same discovery dialogue. A change to the public settlement,
visible contact/location set, or active cause-free `LocalProblemSymptom` set
invalidates that backoff immediately. The runner does not subscribe to private
problem authority, rumor receipts, causes, or private threat disclosures.

The runner records a bounded public attempt and result for that action:
official minute, coarse active-symptom count and oldest-age bucket, bounded
visible-candidate count, selected location class, bounded owner open-case
count, and whether public backoff suppressed the attempt. It does not put case
IDs, causes, receipt data, or private threat disclosures into these discovery
diagnostics. A new owner-visible open case is the postcondition for an
observer-safe `rumor_delivered=true`. Stable result reasons distinguish
`rumor_delivered`, `no_public_rumor_available`, `no_visible_contacts`, and
unchanged-public-state suppression. Reports separately count actual attempts,
fruitful attempts, unproductive decisions, and backoff suppressions; a
suppressed retry is not counted as an attempted action. The pre-action
quest-decision event distinguishes policy intent from selection with
`quest_intended` and `quest_selected`; the later discovery-result event alone
reports the postcondition and whether the ordinary activity fallback follows.

The first observation of each owner-scoped open generated case is a separate
bounded `generated_case_intake`. Identity is the composite
`(owner_character_id, case_id)`, because the same public case ID may be
continued independently by more than one owner. Dialogue-created intakes use
the public `dialogue_rumor` source. A case that first appears in the ordinary
owner projection uses `owner_projection_continuation`; the simulator does not
infer hidden provenance. Every unique intake counts exactly one generic quest
attempt, while dialogue discovery and projection continuation retain separate
metrics. Terminal, exact-site, travel, and seen state use the same composite
identity, so one owner's terminal transition cannot suppress another owner's
case clone.

Generated local-problem authority uses the official world clock for its active
window. Dialogue discovery therefore checks problem `starts_at`, `ends_at`, and
resolution against official world time, while journal `learned_at` and
`recorded_at` remain on the observing character's elapsed timeline. Travel,
treatment, and bulk settlement activity can move that observer timeline
independently and must not make a world problem appear prematurely active or
expired.

The runner then follows only owner-scoped
case, journal, lead, dialogue-topic, action, action-outcome, and exact-site-pin
projections. Referred witnesses are never inferred from generated truth:
same-named public candidates are tried in stable order and only the candidate
whose projected session exposes `referred-testimony` for the selected public
case is selected. Public presence is filtered through the settlement's visible
NPC locations before any dialogue attempt, so a resident scheduled at a hidden
service location or carrying a public context/health suppression cannot become
a reducer-failing contact. If that public presence changes between selection
and the authoritative dialogue reducer, the runner records an observer-safe
replan and resumes settlement activity instead of weakening the reducer's
presence check or aborting the run. Investigation
actions and their outcomes are likewise
filtered by exact owner and public case before reducers receive the projected
action ID, method, and version. Exact site travel selects only the pin matching
the party's current case-site occupancy. Combat requires an owner-scoped,
public-case-scoped binding matching party, battle, mission, and site. The state
machine rechecks the current leader and every member's public strategic
condition after each time-advancing action, travel leg, and combat. A completed
case returns any surviving party from its occupied site before the case leaves
the active loop. When a projected action advertises `night_window` with a
bounded `wait_minutes`, the runner uses the ordinary settlement-rest action
when an affordable service is available, otherwise ordinary field rest, then
re-reads the projection, expected version, leader, and party health before
acting. It never parses action prose or reducer errors to decide to wait. The
runner records bounded pre-call evidence for each generated investigation
attempt: immutable public case subject, public case/action IDs, projected
method and summary, expected version, availability reason and wait, and the
actor/party public clocks. A narrowly allowlisted victim-cohort
moved/changed/unavailable reducer result triggers one observer-safe projection
refresh and then defers to the next cycle without aborting, even if the local
subscription cache has not applied a new row yet. The authoritative gateway
projection independently checks the current private cohort binding and exposes
only generic `target_changed` unavailability; it never reveals which target
predicate changed. On the next cycle the runner can choose another available
public action instead of deterministically retrying the stale one. Reports
count replans, and neither events nor failure artifacts copy the raw authority
error.

The state machine is bounded per cycle and falls back to sustainable settlement
activity when no legal projected step is available.

Dialogue retries use a semantic fingerprint of the owner-visible case status,
deduplicated lead meaning, actionable projection state, outcomes, and site
state. Publication timestamps, projection versions, wait countdowns, and fresh
row IDs for repeated testimony do not count as investigation progress, so an
unchanged witness topic is not reopened each cycle or allowed to exhaust the
bounded dialogue-session history.

Travel encounter delays consume ordinary character time and needs without
granting movement. The journey authority extends its elapsed total by that
delay and refreshes the remaining camp forecast, preserving both the delay's
realism and the invariant that an active journey cannot have completed elapsed
time beyond its total forecast.

Reports separately count direct-contract attempts/completions, generated case
intakes and owner-projection continuations, generated cases discovered,
completed by the simulated party's immediate dialogue/action/autoresolve
transition, and closed externally by background resident NPCs. They also count
projected investigation actions, temporal waits and wait minutes, observer-safe
replans, and witness dialogues. Generated-case trace events contain only public
case IDs/subjects, NPC names and locations already visible in the selected
dialogue, projected action summaries, and public outcome wording; they never
read generation manifests, canonical causes/sites, reliability, hostile
authority, custody authority, or outcome authority. The same report exposes
unique owner-party discoveries, exact-site-ready cases, finance-blocked cycles,
case-site journeys, provision purchases, and actual public gold spent. Identical
affordability signatures enter backoff until the required budget or observable
funds change. That cache is scoped by party, acting owner, and public
case/contract finance key, so two owners cannot inherit one another's backoff.
Direct contracts preflight against the greatest public distance among their case
destinations before acceptance, then select the disclosed owner-scoped pin by
minimum-distance, stable-site ordering and re-run observer-safe provisioning for
that exact pin before travel. Thus a temporary shortfall does not withdraw the
offer or fund travel to a different destination. An explicit post-defeat
cannot-reprovision abandonment is reported as abandonment rather than deferral.

Live simulated NPCs inspect persistent equipment condition before choosing
quests or settlement activity. They submit repairable damaged equipment to the
appropriate local smith, wait through the ordinary rest reducer until the
longest ETA, and retrieve every completed order before continuing. Their
replacement utility is discounted by current condition, so maintenance competes
coherently with buying a replacement. Reports include submissions, retrievals,
repair wait time, worst final condition, and outstanding orders; deterministic
simulation setup seeds damage through a reducer guarded to registered simulation
characters.

Before any settlement departure, the driver now prepares every living party
member rather than only the leader. Where a public general-market storefront and
provider exist, it buys a single field tent directly into ordinary party
custody; a settlement with no such public provider authorizes a tracked bivouac
fallback instead of trapping the party in settlement forever. It equips only
upgrades that preserve at least 20 percent of the public linear carrying margin,
and maintains twenty personally owned arrows for each member whose public
equipped capability is ranged. Shared earned stake may be withdrawn through the
ordinary custody reducer to fund a member's arrows, while the same visible
medical reserve used elsewhere remains protected. Equipment replacements route
through their matching public forge, armoury, or tailor provider. They require
both the canonical service and item stock category, reject ambiguous default
providers before applying current hours, and use one authoritative transaction
to debit only the member's earned stake and complete the personal purchase
within the conservative observer-safe quote. If a visible provider exists but
shelter, ammunition, quote, or carrying margin cannot be made safe, the party
performs settlement activity instead of departing. Current wetness above 80
percent or absolute thermal strain above 2,500 also requires indoor recovery
before departure. The SDK exposes neither route-weather forecasts nor item
insulation/weatherproofing to this simulator, so route-weather readiness is
explicitly recorded as unavailable and only the current public condition can
gate departure; this is a projection gap, not a claim that future exposure is
safe. Every field-rest path selects a party-owned tent when present, including
forecast camps, bounded expedition recovery, passive/evacuation recovery, and
field investigation waits. The authoritative rest reducer still validates
custody and applies the actual exposure mechanics.

For an owner-scoped generated case site, the driver combines the public route,
action, return, fatigue, and thermal projections before departing. A delayed
safe window advances every living party member to one common clock frontier,
verifies that no member was skipped, reruns medical and departure readiness, and
follows through in the same turn. The forecast searches the next seven days but
performs public settlement rest in at most one-day increments. It samples every
legal hour for the four policy-relevant walking schedules (current, widened
round-trip, action breakpoint, and movement breakpoint), while the exhaustive
lower-priority schedule variants retain one daily walking-start sample so a cold
unsafe route does not require tens of thousands of full party forecasts. A
delayed candidate's recovered baseline can authorize only that real settlement
wait; the party cannot depart until the public rest and revalidation actually
succeed. Failure telemetry classifies a route as thermally unsafe in all windows
only when every complete candidate is thermal unsafe; one thermally viable
candidate instead permits bounded fatigue recovery. No thermal result is cached
across changing public party, equipment, action, route, or condition state.

Each per-member settlement rest in that safe-departure wait rechecks the party's
public location before another member acts. If the rest relocates the party to
an activity-incident case site, the wait stops immediately, records a bounded
`safe_departure_wait_relocated` event instead of claiming clock-frontier lag,
and retains only the exact observed `(party, case site) -> origin settlement`
fallback used by ordinary idle-site return policy. The simulator neither
subscribes to nor parses the private incident.

After an off-settlement action, the driver refreshes the versioned public
frontier. It may continue at the occupied site only when the next available
action requires that exact site and a fresh worst-case action-plus-return
fatigue and thermal projection is `Ready`. Otherwise the reserved return
remains mandatory. The existing per-cycle step cap bounds repeated same-site
fieldwork.

Core-loop reports expose per-agent thermal state, wetness, thermal strain,
personal ammunition, carried load, carrying capacity, equipment readiness, and
party-tent quantity. Aggregate metrics record tent purchases and uses, tent-rest
failures, ammunition purchases and shortages, readiness suppressions,
provider-unavailable bivouac departures, route-projection gaps, peak
load/capacity, minimum carrying margin, and peak exposure. Death events include
the authoritative cause, source, source ID, and strategic minute, and the
structured failure artifact carry the same observer-safe survival context so a
policy mistake can be distinguished from an authoritative reducer or mechanics
failure without importing private state. General merchant presence has the same
actor-clock authority race as contract issuers. An exact authoritative
`Merchant service provider is not available` rejection is treated like the
corresponding public provider-unavailable result only for the simulator's known
tent, journey-provision, ammunition, first-aid, and optional equipment
operations. Tent readiness explicitly chooses its existing bivouac policy;
essential provisions and ammunition defer departure; optional first-aid material
and equipment purchases are skipped. These races do not increment
reducer-failure, purchase, unit, or spend metrics. Different operations
(including the typed herbalist path), different messages, and all other merchant
failures remain fatal and counted. The simulator subscribes to public
physical-object, containment, measured amount, and container-liquid projections.
Load and recovery-supply accounting resolve ultimate personal or party custody,
include nested objects and contained water, scale measured non-food material
mass, and reject malformed or fixture-rooted object graphs. This is
observer-safe accounting, not custody authority.

Completed investigation failures publish an ordinary public outcome. When a
successful reducer call advances the public party clock but publishes no new
outcome, the trace instead records `planned_interval_clipped`, the projected
duration band, and actual elapsed minutes. This preserves an authoritative
condition or death interruption rather than calling it an unproductive agent
decision.
`locate_contact` availability also mirrors the referred resident's public
scheduled presence at the projected party minute. An ordinary schedule gap
publishes a bounded wait; public health/context suppression fails closed
without exposing private outbreak state.

Foraging remains intentionally outside autonomous policy. Its ordinary gateway
flow requires authoritative terrain attestation; the simulator neither forges
that attestation nor reads private terrain or resource authority to bypass it.

Medical needs are evaluated before repairs, and repairs before equipment
upgrades. The disposable fixture accepts a validated disease scenario ID,
defaulting to influenza, behind the same claimed-run capability boundary as
other simulator-only setup. Policy observes only public condition, the narrow
public symptomatic/critical signal, and the gateway-authorized physiology chart.
It never subscribes to infection episodes or reconstructs hidden disease truth.
A usable chart must belong to the patient, name a simulator-controlled living
observer who is a co-located member of the patient's current party, and meet the
public confidence floor. Charts older than one strategic day are rejected. Among
fresh rows, confidence ranks before recency, then stable observer/chart identity
breaks ties, so a minute-newer weak self-reading cannot displace a skilled party
clinician; that observer performs the ordinary intervention reducer as
clinician.

For every positively scored preparation that the visible herbalist stocks, the
policy reproduces the authoritative public quote and scores its public generic
meter deltas against the chart's public weighted differential and disease meter
definitions. Expected relief is reduced by direct worsening and adverse meter
effects. Scores are quantized and ties break by quote then preparation ID, so
identical chart, inventory, and storefront state yields the same choice. The
course is bought into (or reused from) the patient's inventory and consumed
through the ordinary administration reducer; private sensitivity and outcome
remain authoritative. Low/no confidence, an active matching intervention, no
positive profile, missing stock, or an unaffordable course falls back to
supportive/natural rest. ORS remains the concrete conservative reserve course
used by discretionary-spending policy; the medical selector may choose a
different publicly supported preparation. A positively scored course already in
the patient's inventory is eligible without any herbalist, stock, or quote;
storefront authority is required only when purchase is necessary, and suitable
owned medicine ranks before purchases. A public active intervention suppresses
additional administration until it ends. Affordability includes the visible cost
of the required one-day rest venue, preferring a free temple to a paid inn. An
affordable symptomatic character buys a course; an unaffordable character, a
settlement without an herbalist, or a nonsymptomatic convalescent instead takes
bounded one-day natural recovery. Equipment maintenance retains one locally
quoted course as an emergency reserve rather than consuming every coin before a
later symptom becomes visible. It rests in bounded one-day steps until ready.
Before each choice, the trace records only public condition, symptomatic status,
settlement, purse, observer ID, confidence band, a bounded differential summary,
preparation, public score, route, quote, authoritative reducer outcome,
affordability, action, and reason. Recovery completion records
`recovery_context=public_symptoms` and keeps the pre-rest symptomatic
observation separate from the newly read post-rest observation; it does not
claim a private physiological cause. The medical-rest schedule is installed
before chart, co-location, inventory, and quote selection, because that
authority call may synchronize a lagging clock; all inputs are re-read before
any charge. Administration is another terminal boundary: liveness and public
condition are re-read immediately, actual spend and outcome are recorded, and a
dead patient is never sent to a rest reducer. Medicated rest reports 1,440
requested minutes separately from the authoritative patient-clock delta and
contributes only that actual delta to treatment-rest metrics. For a
nonsymptomatic patient who cannot afford the inn and lacks a supplied temple
rest, the policy deterministically selects the solvent co-located living party
member with the greatest public purse after retaining that payer's own visible
medical reserve (lowest character ID breaks a tie). The patient still pays
normally whenever able. Sponsorship invokes a narrow ordinary reducer: the
patient contributes their available purse and the authenticated payer pays only
the remaining portion of the inn's exact authoritative one-day quote directly
for the named patient. It rejects stale quotes, self-sponsorship, affordable
patients, missing party membership, different settlements, missing Inn service,
insufficient payer funds, and patients without a public recovery need; it never
transfers arbitrary coin. Party treasury and payer stake are diagnostic context,
not an extra source of spendable personal funds. If neither self-payment nor
sponsorship is available, an available Temple remains a free, time-advancing
last resort even without a full day of visible food, with ordinary hunger
consequences instead of a zero-time suppression loop. Sponsored-rest metrics and
bounded events record payer, patient, public quote and split, the payer's
reserve and spendable funds, public treasury/stake, exact spend, pre/post
purses, and pre/post public condition. They do not read private disease or
exposure state. Medication itself remains patient-funded; sponsorship is
deliberately limited to lodging until treatment purchase and custody can be
extended without broad transfer authority. The sponsored-rest requested-minute
and elapsed-minute metrics are separate: elapsed time is the public
patient-clock delta observed after the reducer, so a terminal zero-minute or
partial interval is not reported as a full day. `sponsored_settlement_rests`
counts successful reducer callbacks, including a zero-time terminal clip;
`sponsored_settlement_rest_elapsed_minutes` also contributes to the broader
`treatment_rest_minutes`, and sponsored payment contributes to
`treatment_gold_spent`, so those aggregates intentionally overlap rather than
representing disjoint categories. Medical-decision events derive `rest_venue`
from the selected action: natural, sponsored, and emergency recovery use the
natural venue, while buy-and-rest uses the medicated venue. While recovery is
active it authoritatively replaces the saved personality schedule with pure
rest, then restores that profile schedule after recovery so labor or thievery
cannot interrupt convalescence with an incident. Passive party Physiology
observation remains automatic and authoritative; the simulator does not invoke a
diagnosis shortcut. Quests remain suppressed while a member is unsafe. Reports
audit purchases, administrations, treatment gold and time, recoveries,
suppression, and terminal deaths. Because preparation and treatment can advance
time, both generated-case and direct-contract drivers re-read the public current
leader, owner relationship, party membership, life, and readiness after each
such batch. They defer before choosing a projection or invoking the next quest
reducer if ownership changed or any member remains unsafe.

Safety is intentionally strict. URLs are parsed structurally and must be an
exact credential-free HTTP loopback origin with no path, query, or fragment.
The command accepts only an `adventuresim-sim-*` database and refuses any
pre-existing run, character, or party state. Fixture mode also refuses any
settlement or import state. Full-world mode permits settlements only when a
completed `world_data_import` proves they came from the pinned compiled world,
and records its artifact ID and manifest digest in the report. It atomically
claims the database with an owner identity and nonce before creating simulation
characters. Bootstrap
configuration requires that claim and permanently marks each simulated
character by run and agent ID; simulated and ordinary characters cannot merge
parties. In addition, ordinary module builds compile with simulation claims
disabled. The recipe creates 32 random bytes in memory, exposes them to exactly
one module build and runner process through `ADVENTURESIM_SIM_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN`,
and never accepts the capability as a CLI argument or writes it to a report.
The public claim reducer checks that build-time capability before inspecting
database freshness. The recipe creates a nonce-named database, exposes no
host/database override, and deletes it on exit. Population, duration, cycles,
action waits, camp continuation, defeat retries, and recovery loops are bounded.

There are two distinct random streams. The CLI seed deterministically controls
profiles and policy choices. Combat is authoritative: the autoresolver obtains
its seed from server RNG, and reports record that actual seed together with
rounds, summary, and log. Consequently the native backend supports exact replay,
while a core-loop rerun reproduces policy inputs but not necessarily combat
outcomes. Its trace is the debugging artifact. Reports identify the server,
database, and claimed run; the current SDK does not expose a deployed module
binary digest.

Current limitations are:

- no native Raiding execution until an authoritative equipped-capability
  observation exists (generated schedules exclude it and custom schedules are
  rejected);
- no parity claim for live bulk multi-day rest, whose aggregate rounding and
  incident interruption semantics differ from repeated one-day actions;
- the bounded bootstrap applies generated attributes, initial skills, and
  downtime schedules, while equipment starts from the normal character
  creator before policy-driven upgrades;
- party loot is liquidated through the shared party treasury; equipment
  upgrades atomically consume at most the character's earned stake while
  purchasing into personal custody;
- duplicate detection covers the simulator's semantic action stream, not the
  strategic-web rendered DOM;
- no tactical ticks and no persistent production NPC rows.

```

The default fixture recipe enables deterministic quest coverage after forming
at least two ordinary parties. One leader receives a low-difficulty offered
contract backed by private case, site, hostile-group, and real issuer
authority. A different leader receives a generated local problem through the
ordinary public rumor, dialogue, delivery, and intake flow. Neither path is
auto-accepted or granted a successful outcome. The capability-owned fixture
also makes each designated leader's starting settlement expose a valid general
storefront with canonical general-goods stock and exactly one present default
merchant. Parties still buy journey food and containers through ordinary
merchant pricing, payment, and party-custody mechanics using their bounded
working purses; the fixture does not grant provisions or purchase metrics.

The report records the exact seeded contract and generated-case IDs together
with their designated leaders and parties. Lifecycle milestones are attributed
only when those IDs are observed on events from the designated leader; global
quest counters cannot satisfy fixture coverage.

Coverage succeeds only when reducer failures, duplicate semantic events,
stuck detections, and encounter wipes remain zero; all final agents are alive,
non-critical, and back in a settlement; both direct and generated intake paths
were attempted; the exact generated case was discovered and completed; attempt
totals are consistent; and the exact direct contract was accepted, traveled to,
encountered, and reported successfully. A safe authoritative retreat and
abandonment remains diagnostic evidence but never satisfies full coverage.
Defeats are valid intermediate evidence only when the required successful
lifecycles still complete; deaths and wipes are not. The command writes
`report.json` before evaluating these gates.
On failure it also writes `failure.json` with category
`quest_coverage_acceptance` and the first unmet metric as `reason_code`.

`strategic-sim-core-loop-world` remains an exploratory imported-world run. It
does not install or require the deterministic coverage fixture because doing
so would replace evidence about imported-world availability with seeded
authority.

## Lifecycle acceptance tier

`strategic-sim-lifecycle` is a credential-free offline acceptance scenario for
housing, Socializing, courtship, marriage, spouse Leisure, conception, birth,
and bounded NPC causal work. It composes the authoritative pure lifecycle rules
used by the strategic module and runs the same three-year scenario through a
single whole-horizon request and through daily requests.

The explicit output directory must not already exist. A successful run creates
three immutable, observer-safe artifacts:

- `whole.json` and `daily.json` contain identical normalized lifecycle metrics;
- `comparison.json` records both artifact digests, the normalized digest,
  pass/fail state, exact differences, and a privacy-canary audit.

The reports use public role labels rather than character, relationship, or
settlement authority IDs. They do not expose raw affinity values, father
approval values, check difficulty, or other hidden relationship authority.
They assert the formal/informal route boundaries and secrecy outcomes without
serializing those inputs.

The scenario covers the exactly-three-tier housing catalog; renter and owner
partial-funds billing; bounded residence and spouse morale; deterministic
Socializing priority and personality training; formal and informal courtship;
family secrecy checks; one-year wedding notice and one-time dowry settlement;
conserved joint Leisure with 40-in-10,000 hourly conception trials; 280-day
gestation, deterministic newborn identity and dependent status; and a bounded
NPC work queue. Whole-versus-daily equality is measured over the complete
normalized result.

This is explicitly the `offline_authoritative_pure_rules` evidence tier. It
does not invoke SpacetimeDB reducers, exercise persistence or concurrent
reservations, subscribe to projections, or drive the browser. Reducer access,
database concurrency, clock wakeups, and UI privacy remain responsibilities of
the strategic module integration and web suites; this command must not be
reported as evidence for those seams.

## Quest evaluators

There are two gameplay evaluator surfaces and one offline content-analysis
surface, with deliberately different boundaries.

### Offline generated-content analyzer

`quest-analyze` projects deterministic generated investigations into an
observer-safe, in-memory `PlayerFrame`. It is useful for generator regression,
route diversity, policy fingerprints, dead ends, loops, correction persistence,
and separate public/developer audit artifacts. It does **not** call
SpacetimeDB reducers, exercise the browser, perform tactical combat, or prove
production gameplay behavior.

The default recipe is credential-free and the mock policy round-trips through
the same strict JSON response parser used by an OpenAI-compatible provider:

```powershell
just quest-analyze-mock 41 4
```

This creates `quest-analysis-public.json`, `quest-analysis-developer.json`, and
`quest-analysis-stories.md` as distinct artifacts and refuses to overwrite
them unless direct invocation passes `--overwrite`. The public report contains
only player-visible traces, bounded run provenance, classifications, and
aggregate behavior. Seeds, catalog revisions, canonical truth, structured
factor traces, bridge IDs, generator marginals, and truth-joined
classification/counterfactual audits remain in the developer report. Their
digest join is one-way.

All three artifacts are rendered in memory first. Per-artifact and combined
byte budgets are checked against the exact pretty JSON and Markdown bytes
before any output file is created. Existing-ancestor canonicalization also
prevents distinct-looking paths through symlinked or junction parents from
collapsing public and developer output onto the same file.

Each trace records pre/post observation digests, opaque legal choices, exact
dialogue, public discoveries and corrections, preparation, costs, exhaustion,
and termination. Classifications are bounded answers, never chain-of-thought.
Prepared/unprepared solve rates are descriptive quality slices, not causal
skill or equipment-benefit estimates.
Counterfactual comparisons are made only when different hidden cases naturally
share an identical player-visible initial prefix; absence of such a group is
reported as `not_measured`.

Contract completion, language benefit, tactical combat benefit, causal skill
benefit, and accidental perception discovery are also explicitly
`not_measured` because this projection does not implement those mechanics.
No proxy number should be treated as evidence for them. The privacy audit is a
structural type boundary plus canary scan, not a formal proof.

An observed non-solving run can be promoted into a reviewable deterministic
fixture candidate:

```powershell
just quest-analyze-promote 41 recurring-depredation
cargo run -p adventuresim-strategic-sim -- quest-analyze-replay `
  --fixture quest-analysis-replay-candidate.json
# Replay the reviewed checked-in regression:
just quest-analyze-replay-fixture
```

The versioned fixture joins catalog revision and generator manifest, records
opaque decisions, and checks stable outcome fields. Promotion never silently
commits or approves a fixture. Only step-limit and dead-end failures can be
promoted; provider failures, loop detection, and exhausted runtime budgets
cannot be reproduced from an opaque action list alone.

### Persistent hostile escalation

The reducer-backed core loop advances the same scheduled recurring incidents as
normal settlement activity. NPC adventuring companies remain persistent
recruiting entities, but there is no NPC quest-intervention policy, candidate
view, strategy reducer, outcome table, or story anthology. Unresolved hostile
`RecurringDepredation` cases continue until players resolve them; deterministic
incident ordinals drive bounded combat escalation and public awareness.

Because the production world clock is tied to elapsed wall time, a claimed
disposable simulation has one additional bounded reducer that advances that
same authoritative clock by a requested number of game minutes. The core loop
uses it once per active simulated day, then invokes ordinary settlement
activity so follow-up incidents, escalating penalties, public awareness, and
recruitment all occur through the production systems. The capability is
absent from normal module builds. Simulation characters receive a small
starting purse so an inn-only seed settlement cannot deadlock before its first
labor day; all accommodation and food costs still use ordinary currency rules.

Use the normal isolated recipe:

```powershell
just strategic-sim-core-loop-world target/sim-runs/world-001 42 8 20 30 2
```

Direct expert invocation needs no NPC policy options:

```powershell
cargo run -p adventuresim-strategic-sim -- core-loop `
  --host http://127.0.0.1:3000 --database adventuresim-sim-UNIQUE `
  --run-nonce UNIQUE-NONCE `
  --fixture-disease influenza `
  --imported-world --expected-world-manifest-digest PINNED-DIGEST `
  --output report.json
```

Medical capability evaluation uses a fresh disposable database/output pair for
each `--fixture-disease` scenario. The ordinary matrix is `influenza`,
`dysentery`, `tetanus`, `erysipelas`, and `consumption`; the fantastic matrix is
`mahrdruck`, `shroud_fever`, `bilwisschuss`, and `kobeldunst`. A scenario need
not recover or survive. Its acceptance condition is bounded completion without
a reducer failure or stuck loop, plus a report/failure artifact whose
`fixture_disease` and authoritative death/recovery events attribute the outcome.
The option defaults safely to `influenza`; arbitrary or hidden disease IDs are
rejected before connecting.

### End-to-end browser quest evaluator

The browser evaluator is deliberately separate from the strategic NPC
evaluator. It always uses an LLM and interacts with the running local game only
through visible web controls. The model receives the current screenshot,
visible page text, and opaque handles for visible enabled controls. It cannot
name a reducer, use a quest authority ID, invent an action, or navigate directly
to a guessed route.

Each run writes an immutable screenshot log: `index.html`, `manifest.json`, and
one viewport PNG for the initial state and every subsequent action. The log
therefore shows exactly what was on screen when the model made each decision.
Use a new output directory for every run:

```powershell
just quest-web-eval quest-browser-run-001 `
  http://127.0.0.1:24301 /characters OPENAI_API_KEY gpt-4.1-mini
```

Network use must be explicit, the game URL must be loopback, and provider
endpoints must use HTTPS unless they are loopback test fixtures. The command
fails closed when the named API-key variable is absent. CI exercises the strict
decision protocol and a loopback model fixture; it does not make paid model
requests.

Direct `core-loop` invocation is intentionally an expert-only path: its process
must inherit the same `ADVENTURESIM_SIM_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN` used to compile and
publish that disposable module. There is no token CLI option. Prefer the recipe,
which keeps the capability confined to one shell process and always cleans up.

The full-world recipe is the authoritative core-loop workflow. It publishes a
nonce database with the simulation capability, loads exactly
`target/world-1544.json`, verifies the completed import through the simulator's
typed subscription, checks the file's size and SHA-256 against
`world-runtime-release.lock.json`, requires the observed import manifest to
match that verified file, then runs without calling `seed_simulation_world`. It
chooses the lexicographically first imported settlement ID so the loaded-world
start is deterministic. The explicit output directory must not exist. A
successful run contains `report.json` and `launcher.json`; failed launches
retain `launcher.json` with the failed stage.
The launcher attempts to delete the disposable database on every exit path and
reports `cleanup_failed` with a nonzero exit if deletion is not confirmed.

The reducer-backed core loop subscribes to strategic encounters and resolves
each through the same public reducer used by the Map/camp UI. Its report records
encounter frequency; sneak, detour, attack, run, and surrender choices; escape
eligibility; exact surrendered item/value losses; encounter defeats; and full
party wipes. Encounter events in the trace retain the canonical encounter ID,
chosen action, and authoritative outcome for replay diagnostics.
After any encounter resolves with a living party, the runner re-reads public
encounter, journey, itinerary, health, and destination projections. A normal
journey with an unsafe member holds for recovery, while an evacuation may
continue under its existing ready-companion policy. Exactly one active forecast
camp proceeds through ordinary camp handling; zero active intervals calls
`continue_camp_travel` once, and overlapping intervals fail closed. The
encounter reducer owns its delay once; continuation neither repurchases
provisions nor increments camp-stop metrics, and the next public state may be
another encounter, a journey hold, a camp, or the destination.
