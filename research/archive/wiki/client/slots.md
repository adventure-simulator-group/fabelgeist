# Slots
A **slot** is a physical location on your character's body which an item can be
stored in, or attached to, for quick access via hotkey.

The persisted equipment model separates this fine-grained topology from the
seven combat/health body parts. Equipment locations include head, face, neck,
chest, stomach, back, paired shoulders, arms, hands, legs, and feet. The typed
vocabulary also reserves the four belt and four pocket access points below.
Combat continues to target only left/right arm, left/right leg, head, chest,
and stomach; worn protection is projected back onto those stable regions.

For example, the right hip can be a slot:
* If you have a belt on, you can place a sheath on your left hip with
  <kbd>Q</kbd>.
* If you have a sheath on your left hip, you can put a sword in it.

The goal is for slots to replace menus to access most of your inventory.
Anything not inside a bag should be immediately accessible with a **slot
button**. Slot buttons can overlap with other buttons because they only function
as slot buttons when a [grab button](controls.md#direct-controls) is held.
## Keybindings
Ideally, the location of each slot button should correspond roughly to the
slot's physical location. A button on the left should be used for a slot on the
left side of the body, and we should attempt to group the buttons so that
adjacent slots have adjacent buttons.

| **M+KB** | **Controller** | **Slot** |
|-|-|-|
| <kbd>Q</kbd> | X | Left belt.
| <kbd>E</kbd> | Q | Right belt.
| <kbd>F</kbd> | Y | Front belt.
| <kbd>X</kbd> | A | Back belt.
| <kbd>Tab</kbd> | Select | Left shoulder.
| <kbd>R</kbd> | Start | Right shoulder.
| <kbd>G</kbd> | | Chest.
| <kbd>Y</kbd> | | Stomach.
| <kbd>H</kbd> | | Back.
| <kbd>2</kbd> | ⇐ | Left pocket.
| <kbd>3</kbd> | ⇒ | Right pocket.
| <kbd>1</kbd> | ⇓⇐ | Back-left pocket.
| <kbd>4</kbd> | ⇓⇒ | Back-right pocket.
| <kbd>T</kbd> | ⇑ | Head.
| | ⇓ | Face?
| <kbd>`</kbd> | ⇑⇐ | Left arm.
| <kbd>5</kbd> | ⇑⇒ | Right arm.
| | | Glasses?
| | | Ears?
| <kbd>V</kbd> | | Left leg.
| <kbd>B</kbd> | | Right leg.
| <kbd>Z</kbd> | ⇓⇓⇐ | Left foot.
| <kbd>C</kbd> | ⇓⇓⇒ | Right foot.

The body-slot map deliberately leaves
<kbd>W</kbd><kbd>A</kbd><kbd>S</kbd><kbd>D</kbd> unbound so tactical movement
remains available while donning, doffing, or accessing equipment.

The controller doesn't have quite enough buttons to give every slot its own
button. To get around this, we can assign certain slots to *combinations* of
buttons; because slot inputs require the grab button be held to initiate them,
and we don't execute any action until the grab button is released, no ambiguity
is possible. (For instance, while holding the grab button, the face slot can be
⇑ and glasses can be ⇑⇑; only when we release the grab button does it actually
perform the action.) This is also helpful for controllers that only support four
D-pad directions; the diagonals can just be pressing two directions in either
order. (That is, "down-left" can be "down and then left.")

In the map proposed above, we rely on button combinations for directly adjacent
slots, which we imagine as lying on a navigable grid navigated by the D-pad.
## Layers
Pressing a slot button once selects the outer layer of that slot. Pressing it
again -- without releasing the grab button -- selects one layer deeper. For
example, press <kbd>Q</kbd> once to draw your sword from your sheath, twice to
remove the sheath itself, and three times to remove your belt.

Equipment uses explicit occupancy channels ordered from inside to outside:
held, base clothing, padding/under-armor, flexible armor, rigid armor,
outerwear, accessory, mount, and containment. Channel plus authored order
forms an occupancy cell, so a cloak can coexist with armor and a sheath can
coexist with clothing. Held, base-clothing, padding, flexible-armor,
rigid-armor, and outerwear channels are singleton at each location; authored
order only distinguishes repeatable accessory, mount, and containment cells.
The same item may atomically occupy several locations, and sided garments
author explicit left and right alternatives.

The persisted equipment graph is rooted at the character body. Equipped items
may provide ordered, capacity-limited attachment points, so a belt may parent a
sheath or bag, a sheath may parent a weapon, and a bag may parent contents. A
single placement may require several points (the catalog sword sheath uses two
belt mounts), producing a DAG rather than a single-parent tree.
Reparenting validates the complete destination before mutation. Player-facing
removal and reparenting reject items with children, preventing orphaned graph
rows. Repeated slot input walks body channels outside-to-inside and then child
attachment points in authored order.
## Multi-slot items
Many items, generally clothing and armor, occupy multiple slots. A belt occupies
all four belt slot buttons. It can be equipped and removed using any of these
buttons.
## Slot restrictions
Many items may only occupy specific slots. When such an item is held in your
hand and you hold the corresponding grab button, all buttons not corresponding
to those slots are unavailable.
## GUI
The screen normally gives no indicator for what is in your slots or your hands.
However, holding down any grab button brings up a "map" of your slots with a few
properties:
* This map includes icons for each button and approximately corresponds to the
  keyboard/controller; the relative position of each slot should be based on the
  relative position of each button.
* When holding an item, any slot it may be placed in is white, and all others
  are grayed out; if your hand is empty, slots with items in them are white, and
  empty ones are greyed out.
* Only the outermost occupied item in a slot is visible. Items that occupy
  multiple slots contiguously span all relevant slots.

The strategic inventory uses a compact version of this map. An equipped row
shows every applicable QWERTY key; lighter key text is nearer the surface and
darker text is farther underneath. Clicking an equipped row removes it
directly. Clicking an unequipped row opens the QWERTY map. Invalid keys are
dimmed and flash red when pressed. Eligible occupied slots show their current
item icon and swap that occupant out when selected; eligible empty slots keep
the icon area as empty negative space. A valid key can be clicked or pressed,
and selects the outermost compatible placement or attachment target reachable
through that slot. Hovering over any equippable row control previews the map
without a modal backdrop and accepts a slot key immediately, including moving
an already equipped item to another compatible placement. Reaching the control
with keyboard Tab navigation shows the same preview while leaving Tab
navigation active; press Space to open the modal, then choose a slot key or
press Escape to close it. An equipped item's current placement is highlighted
and carries its item icon in either map. Clicking an equipped control still
unequips it.

## Tactical implementation

In direct tactical control, holding LMB opens the right-hand egui map and
holding MMB opens the left-hand map. RMB-held aim/attack takes precedence and
prevents a new grab. If both grab buttons compete, the first active grab owns
the interaction until release. Slot input is preview-only while held; one
ordered request commits on release. Repeating a key walks that key's authored
location alternatives and then deeper layers deterministically. WASD is never
consumed by the map.

An empty hand may draw an occupied reachable layer. A full hand may place into
a compatible empty destination or atomically swap an occupied destination
into the hand. The HUD dims invalid choices and flashes rejected input without
sending a mutation. Releasing without a selection drops a held item; releasing
an empty hand is a no-op unless auto-aim finds a reachable scene item. In that
case the scene item is selected automatically and pickup commits on release; an
explicit slot selection takes precedence. The opposite hand remains an explicit
HUD choice.

Ground pickup uses a soft auto-aim rather than a hard cursor cone. Among scene
items within two metres of the character and with clear terrain line of sight,
the client selects the item whose direction is closest to the camera centre;
ties prefer the item closer to the character and then stable entity order. With
no better candidate, an in-range item may therefore be selected even beside or
behind the current view. The item that would be picked up on release has a white
shader-rendered silhouette outline and its catalog icon appears beside the
active-hand indicator.

The tactical server re-resolves every selection against mapped ECS entities
and validates control, action sequence/revision, expected source/destination,
compatibility, every parent requirement, attachment tags/capacity, cycles,
children, and pickup range/line of sight before applying a batch. Ordered DAG
traversal exposes occupied children and empty authored attachment capacities;
multi-parent placement reserves every required edge atomically. These
changes exist only in the mission ECS snapshot and never replace the durable
strategic equipment graph.

Worn-item presentation follows the animated rig rather than fixed world-space
offsets. Each character location resolves to a semantic bone: head and face to
`c_head`, neck to `c_neck`, chest and back to `c_spine3`, stomach to `c_spine1`,
shoulders to `l_clavicle` or `r_clavicle`, arms to `*_uparm`, hands to
`*_wrist`, legs to `*_upleg`, feet to `*_foot`, belt and rear-pocket locations
to anatomical `root`, and side pockets to the corresponding `*_upleg`. The item
placeholder root is a child of that bone. Items in an attachment chain, such as
a sword in a sheath on a belt, resolve through their parents to the same body
bone. A placeholder remains hidden until its owner's authored rig and target
bone are available, preventing a flash at the world origin.

MHR's local joint axes are deliberately rolled and don't define equipment
orientation. The client derives a worn placeholder's bind direction from the
relevant semantic joint pair, such as upper arm to forearm or thigh to shin,
then follows only the bone's animated deformation away from that bind pose.
Held weapons use the same bind-relative correction at `l_weapon` or `r_weapon`,
with the item's local +Y axis pointing toward its tip in character space.

Placeholder size and placement relative to that root are catalog data, not HUD
or renderer constants. Every `content/items/*.yaml` equipment definition authors
`physical.dimensions_m` and `physical.anchor_offset_m`; held weapons use the
same anchor as their grip socket. Dropped-item colliders continue to use the
identical authored box and anchor.

The HUD renders only the outermost occupied item reachable through each slot.
For example, a sheathed weapon is shown by itself; after it is drawn, the
newly exposed sheath becomes the slot's visible and actionable item. Inner
layers and empty attachment capacities are not shown.
The tactical map is a transparent, bottom-anchored overlay so the reticle and
the object under it remain unobstructed. Visible copy is limited to the slot
keys and catalog Game Icons, with full item/action descriptions appearing only
on hover. With an item in the active hand, compatible destinations are bright
and incompatible destinations are dark and translucent. With an empty hand,
occupied slots are bright while empty slots are dark and translucent.
Contiguous mapped cells are connected into one visual span only when the
currently visible item itself occupies multiple locations.

## Bags
Your entire inventory won't necessarily fit into the slot system, which is fine.
The slot system is intended not to replace "standard inventory management"
altogether but to make a *significant subset* of your inventory more manageable,
that being the subset of items that you need readily accessible. If you don't
need a given item readily accessible, you can put it in a bag.

A bag still occupies a slot, but it can hold multiple items. For example, a
backpack is a bag which is slung over your shoulder(s).[^1] To access a bag's
internal contents, you must grab the bag into one of your hands; when you are
holding the bag, the grab button for the hand opposite the hand holding the bag
is used to grab/place into it, and the hand holding the bag functions normally:
if you simply press the associated grab button, you will drop the bag, and if
you hold it and press a slot, you will place the bag in that slot.

[^1]: In the real world, carrying a backpack on one shoulder can lead to strain, pain, and posture problems. It is always recommended to use both shoulder straps.
## Alternative controls
The goal of the slot system is to obviate the need for menus in inventory
management, for the most part, and thereby simplify most aspects of inventory
management. Following the philosophy laid out in the [Controls](controls.md)
page, it will likely be hard to learn but ultimately speed up gameplay for
experienced users on account of its consistency and unambiguity.

If this is not the case, we can also try more of a middle ground with
conventional systems. For instance, we could turn all slot buttons into hotkeys
untethered to any physical locations on the body. Players would still place
items onto these hotkeys to equip them, but it wouldn't matter which button they
pressed. This would make layering and multi-slot buttons a mess, so clothing and
armor would just have to be done through a normal inventory menu. Sheaths and
holsters would be handled like clothing; players would have to equip them from a
menu and be forbidden from hotkeying a weapon without having equipped a sheath
to put it in.
