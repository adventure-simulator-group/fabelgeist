# Controls
This page only covers controls relating to movement, attacking, and
blocking/dodging. Hotkeys are described on the [slots](slots.md) page, and menus
are described in their respective pages:
* [Travel screen](../strategic/travel.md)
* [Inventory](../shared/inventory.md)
* [Character select](../strategic/character.md)
* [Stats](../shared/stats.md)

Much of this page is liable to change in the near future. We assume many of our
developers will be interested in taking ownership and providing input on game
design, which we strongly encourage. Thus, the goal of this page isn't really to
describe the game's controls; the top priority is to provide a list of design
goals and principles for the controls, mostly downstream of the principles laid
out in the [project introduction](../index.md). After that, we provide a
tentative proposal/outline for a control scheme which meets those goals.

## Goals
In order of importance, we want controls which are unambiguous; comprehensive;
immediate; convenient; and intuitive.[^00]

[^00]: Also, as a broad note, we would rather follow operating system conventions than video game conventions wherever we can, especially for menus and any RTS-like controls. Video game conventions are designed for people who've played a lot of video games; OS conventions are designed for people.

### Unambiguous
We are opposed to "context-sensitive actions" where the response to user input
depends on the state of the game, particularly when the state is something
continuous like your character's position or what you're looking at.

![A screenshot of *HITMAN 2* (2018) illustrating the game's prolific context-sensitive actions. I say this as a fan.](https://i.redd.it/w3mwmybfsrl21.jpg "I couldn't find the gif of Agent 47 trying to press E to dump a body in a container and instead pressing E to dump a body over a railing into the crowd below. This will suffice.")

Certainly context-sensitive actions can make your controls "simpler" in the
sense that you're using fewer buttons, but it'll also make them a *lot* more
cumbersome than they have to be, and your player may end up quite surprised by
what his character ends up doing in response to a given input. There are games
with "simple" controls, enabled by context-sensitive actions, where no matter
how much you play them, you can't perform these actions on instinct because you
must always ensure the context is appropriate for them. That's not to mention
anything with menus, which are worse for this on an entirely different level.

None of this for us! [*Space Station 13*](https://spacestation13.com/)'s
controls are
[nowhere close to ideal](https://paradisestation.org/wiki/images/0/04/Keyboard-layout-complete.png),
but what they have going for them is that once you get *used* to the controls,
they're very good at becoming instinct: a quality very much worth replicating.
Our contrarian view is that reliable beats simple every time.[^0]

[^0]: By "every time", we mean it. We believe that given enough playtime, someone who's never played a game in his life would *prefer* a game with *SS13*-like unambiguous controls to a game with *Hitman*'s. You can generally compare our view on mass appeal to that of [Stanley Kubrick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Kubrick#Philosophy):

    > Kubrick likened the understanding of his films to popular music, in that **whatever the background or intellect of the individual, a Beatles record, for instance, can be appreciated both by the Alabama truck driver and the young Cambridge intellectual**, because their "emotions and subconscious are far more similar than their intellects". He believed that the subconscious emotional reaction experienced by audiences was far more powerful in the film medium than in any other traditional verbal form, and was one of the reasons why he often relied on long periods in his films without dialogue, placing emphasis on images and sound... When deciding on a subject for a film, there were many aspects that he looked for, and he always made films which would **"appeal to every sort of viewer, whatever their expectation of film"**.
	
In short, contrary to popular belief, if you want to best appeal to the masses,
you don't actually *want* to simplify things. *2001: A Space Odyssey* is the
highest-grossing film of 1968 in the United States and Canada. There's a
[Pareto frontier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_front) of artistic merit
and mass appeal, on which sat Kubrick and the Beatles, and we're aiming right
for it.

### Comprehensive
You should be able to make your character do anything he or she could physically
do which would be situationally advantageous.[^1]

[^1]: That's an important caveat. There are situations where you might want to go prone, but dedicated yoga position buttons are not a priority. (This may sound like an argument for context-sensitive actions, and in some cases it may be; as stated above, our primary opposition is to *continuous-state* context-sensitive actions, which leaves things open for contexts depending on discrete states, say *in yoga class* vs. *not in yoga class*.)

### Immediate
In cases where a button does one thing if single-tapped but something else if
double-tapped or held, some games will start an invisible timer after a first
tap is registered, delaying the onset of the following animation until the
player's intention is made clear (with a second tap/hold or lack thereof).

We will not be one of those games. It's a fair enough solution, but we want
immediate feedback for the player, and we don't want any invisible timers to
delay post-tap animation starts solely for the sake of single-/double-tap
differentiation. Note this doesn't preclude *all* timers; we may certainly have
two time-differentiated inputs which share the same starting animation.

### Convenient
Buttons that you press often should be near your fingers. Buttons that you press
often, like to grab an item, or need to be able to press *immediately*, like to
dodge, should not use the same fingers as those needed to look and move.[^2]

[^2]: Thus, grabbing and dodging shouldn't use the thumbs on a controller.

### Intuitive
All else being equal, it'll be nice if the game's controls are intuitive and
easy to learn, but this isn't a priority.

To the extent that the game's controls are complex, it'll be great if the
complexity is optional, especially at the character level. Playing as an
alchemist with a bandolier of different potions and doodads might require you to
use more buttons than a naked barbarian with a big stick, and starter players
may be encouraged to play characters more like the latter.

But ultimately, our contrarian view is that new players don't actually want
"simple" controls; they want [reliable](#unambiguous) controls. Insofar as
that's true, following the previous guidelines should already get us where we
want to be *vis-à-vis* accessibility.

## Proposal
With our design goals established, we now suggest a tentative outline for the
control scheme.

One feature we quite want in the game eventually is a split between *direct* and
*indirect* controls. By default, the player has direct control of his character,
and the game plays like an action game, but with a toggle, the player may
relinquish control to an AI and direct it with RTS-like controls. You'd
generally use this feature to navigate large, boring areas, to order around
multiple characters, or simply because you don't like action games.

We posit control schemes for both modes below.

### Direct controls
The tactical client defaults to a stability-first third-person camera and
retains <kbd>F9</kbd> as a development toggle for first person. One stateful rig
supplies two continuous configurations. Lowered guard uses a centered orbit
with bounded, vertically damped focus following and a modest screen-space
sweet spot. Raised guard blends to a tighter right-shoulder view while
preserving yaw, pitch, and the movement reference; direct look input is never
rotationally smoothed in either configuration.

The camera sweeps a volume from its shoulder pivot to the desired boom
endpoint. Hard geometry retracts the boom immediately and clears with a slower
hysteretic recovery; soft occluders may be tagged to remain outside the camera
collision policy. Tight-space retraction also recenters the shoulder offset.
Raised aiming selects a center-screen world point, then checks the actual path
from a presentation muzzle origin. The reticle reports a blocked muzzle path,
so the displaced camera cannot grant a shot through nearby cover. In debug
builds, <kbd>F6</kbd> exposes rig, collision, smoothing, and aim telemetry.

> Halbe: I assume that first person is easier because with third-person cameras,
> you need to handle a lot of edge cases to avoid awkwardness in tight spaces or
> near thin obstacles like trees, not to mention smoothing out the motion or
> reconciling the shoulder offset when aiming. However, if I am mistaken in my
> assumptions, we should implement whichever is easier for the MVP.

| **M+KB** | **Controller** | **Function** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| <kbd>W</kbd><kbd>A</kbd><kbd>S</kbd><kbd>D</kbd> | Left Stick | Movement. | Keyboard movement walks by default and toggles jogging with Caps Lock. Pressing <kbd>Shift</kbd> starts sprinting immediately: release within 0.25 seconds to latch sprint, then press again or stop providing movement input to stop sprinting; hold longer than 0.25 seconds to sprint only until release. Analogue stick deflection selects the continuous pace up to sprint at full deflection. Jog is the character's endurance-neutral pace; sprint is limited by leg strength relative to total carried weight. Prone and supine both use character-relative tank controls, with lateral travel limited to three-eighths speed. Their shared walking speed is 0.45 m/s, neutral jogging scales with Endurance, and sprinting reaches 2.0 m/s at an exhaustion cost. Supine movement toward the feet is halved; movement toward the head retains the prone speed. Prone movement is disabled while aiming. |
| Mouse | Right Stick | Look. | |
| <kbd>F9</kbd> | | Toggle first-/third-person camera. | Third person preserves the same immediate look direction across centered and raised-weapon shoulder profiles. |
| Hold RMB | Hold LT | Aim / block. | This state never toggles or persists: releasing the button immediately lowers the weapon. A ranged weapon aims; a melee weapon blocks. The neck and head procedurally attempt to follow camera yaw and pitch, with each of the two neck bones and the head limited to pi/8 per axis. Ordinary raised movement uses procedural combat steps. Sprint input while raised instead produces an endurance-neutral jog with the upper body still aiming or blocking. While prone or supine, held aim selects one of four discrete camera sectors: prone, right half-roll, supine, or left half-roll. Sector edges have angular stickiness so camera jitter cannot rapidly swap poses; the authored roll interpolates only after a new sector is committed. Releasing aim settles an active interpolation to its nearest prone or supine contact. Moving the camera while not aiming never changes downed contact. |
| Press and release <kbd>Space</kbd> | RT | Jump. | Keyboard jump launches on release only while aim/block is lowered. Aim/block suppresses the ordinary jump and reserves Space for the three-button quickstep chord described below; aim/block + Space without WASD does nothing. Lowering aim/block before releasing a held Space allows it to complete as a normal jump. While Space is held upright without aim/block, a presentation-only anticipation lowers the hips and folds the spine slightly forward; it does not change authoritative posture, movement pace, or movement speed. The release increments a sequenced command that is repeated in subsequent input updates until superseded, so loss of the release packet can delay but cannot discard the action. Controller RT retains its immediate press edge. Controller South/A is deliberately unbound. |
| RMB + press/release LMB | LT + RT | Main-hand attack. | Releasing LMB within 0.2 seconds performs the weapon's preferred swing or thrust; releasing it later performs the alternate. Holding transitions locally toward the alternate frame-0 guard immediately and replicates that preparation after 0.2 seconds. Controller trigger pressure selects preferred at 95% or above and alternate below 95%, including replicated preparation when the threshold is crossed. Missing families use the available main-hand fallback. A newer release replaces the one-entry buffer; matching attacks continue through frames 8/12 when authored. |
| RMB + press/release MMB | Not mapped | Offhand attack. | MMB release attacks with the left hand: unarmed when empty, or with its shield, torch, or secondary weapon. A two-anchor offhand clip prepares at frame 0 while held and contacts at frame 4; a single-frame clip keeps the current guard until release. Offhand clips inherit independently through the animation-pack chain. MMB remains a left-hand grab when RMB is not held. |
| LMB | RB | Grab with the right hand. | While held, opens the tactical slot HUD; a selected draw/place/swap commits on release. Releasing without a selection drops a held item. RMB already held reserves LMB for the preferred attack. |
| MMB | LB | Grab with the left hand. | While held, opens the left-hand tactical slot HUD. RMB reserves MMB for an offhand attack. If both grab buttons compete, the first active grab remains active until release. |
| Hold RMB + <kbd>Space</kbd> + <kbd>W</kbd>, <kbd>A</kbd>, <kbd>S</kbd>, or <kbd>D</kbd> | LT + RB while moving | Quickstep / dodge. | A keyboard quickstep begins as soon as aim/block, Space, and at least one WASD direction are simultaneously down, regardless of which key was pressed most recently. WASD selects the camera-relative direction; aim/block + Space alone does nothing and never assumes a backward direction. Keeping the completed chord held automatically requests the next quickstep at each grounded contact; releasing any part stops the chain. Tapping WASD without the other two controls never dodges. The server launches a short, low hop. The authored guard supplies the bent-knee stance, while the client procedurally leans into travel, keeps each foot planted until leg reach or a 45-degree arch limit requires release, and then moves it toward guard position before contact. Touching down immediately restores ordinary raised guard presentation with no landing pose; remaining horizontal momentum continues under about 0.25 seconds of authoritative drag. A new dodge sequence immediately recaptures both takeoff targets. Controller movement is determined from stick input, not current velocity. |
| Press and release <kbd>Left Alt</kbd> without pressing <kbd>W</kbd>, <kbd>A</kbd>, <kbd>S</kbd>, or <kbd>D</kbd> | Press and release Left Stick Click | Toggle prone / standing. | The posture change happens on release. Pressing the control only arms the gesture, so there is no hidden hold timer. Releasing it enters prone from an upright posture, gets up from prone, or begins the direct automatic get-up from supine. Supine get-up applies a root half-turn opposite the turn implicit in the authored supine-to-upright blend, so the two cancel and the rendered character retains one world heading. Prone get-up remains unchanged. Authored transitions temporarily own body facing; if aim remains held, ordinary camera-facing resumes automatically as soon as the character becomes upright, even when the downed roll had not caught up to a rapid camera turn. |
| While prone or supine: <kbd>Space</kbd> + <kbd>A</kbd>/<kbd>D</kbd> | While prone or supine: RT + Left Stick left/right; while holding LT, RB + Left Stick left/right | Roll between prone and supine. | The lateral input chooses the roll direction. Holding the keyboard chord queues the next roll after each contact, producing continuous rolls without submitting commands during the locked transition. One authored leftward roll is pre-mirrored for the other direction and played in reverse when rolling from supine to prone. The authoritative controller supplies 1.3 m/s body-relative lateral movement throughout the 26-tick transition; animation never translates the gameplay transform. A roll preserves the character's root orientation and temporarily suspends held aim-facing until contact. Because a downed character cannot jump, the ordinary jump control becomes a quick roll modifier. When LT is held, RB replaces RT so the attack chord remains unambiguous. A roll also submits a deliberately mediocre active dodge response at 35% of ordinary dodge reflex; the server accepts it only while prone or supine. |
| While prone or supine: hold <kbd>Space</kbd> | While prone or supine: hold RT, or LT + RB | Slowly align head direction with camera yaw. | Space without lateral roll input rotates the downed body's head-to-feet direction toward camera yaw without changing prone/supine contact. Alignment stops immediately on release. Adding <kbd>A</kbd>/<kbd>D</kbd> gives the modifier to the explicit roll instead. |
| Hold <kbd>Left Alt</kbd> + any of <kbd>W</kbd><kbd>A</kbd><kbd>S</kbd><kbd>D</kbd> | RT + Left Stick Click | Dive. | The keyboard dive begins as soon as both parts of the chord are held, regardless of the order in which they were pressed. It cannot repeat until at least one part is released. Movement input selects physical travel and the procedural lean; every direction uses the same authored `dive` upper-body pose. Diving while sprinting instead slides: the animation direction is reversed relative to travel and no launch velocity is added. A forward sprint therefore retains its exact momentum, uses the backward dive animation, and lowers toward supine. Surface drag begins only when the authored body contact reaches the ground. The chord consumes the armed prone toggle. `dive.glb` contributes only bones above the pelvis; when it is missing, `guard` supplies that layer. The runtime holds a directional 40-degree pelvis tilt through flight and composes the pelvis and legs from the load and eventual ground-contact poses. During recovery, directional contact yaw transfers progressively to the root so it preserves one world-space landing heading. Backward contact transfers its half-turn over the recovery interval, canceling the authored transition into supine while retaining the canonical orientation used by rolling. Dives launch lower and faster laterally than ordinary jumps. After authoritative terrain contact, a forward dive blends into prone and a backward dive into supine. A lateral dive instead blends directly into its matching side-roll midpoint, allowing held camera-following to continue without an intervening prone-idle pose; without held aim, that midpoint settles back to prone. |

This is somewhere between a real action game and an RPG wearing an action game's
skin. We aren't actually simulating everything based on hitboxes and projectile
trajectories, but we still want to use some of the player's mechanical skills,
specifically accuracy and reaction time.[^3]

[^3]: This is trivial to [cheat](../engineering/networking.md), but since combat is still (largely) based on stats and (entirely) mediated by the server, it's not a huge deal.

* **Precision** is the value between 0 and 1 representing how much of the hitbox
  the attack has penetrated. Each hitbox is a skin of the body part, while its
  scaled version is a core; and the ratio between distance of the hitreg to skin
  to full distance between skin to core is hit precision.
* **Reflex** is the value between 0 and 1 representing how quickly the defender
  pressed the dodge/parry button after the attack began. Like with precision, we
  aren't sure exactly how to derive this, but a value of 1.0 would correspond to
  pro gamer reaction time (0.1s) and ~0.75 would correspond to old person
  reaction time (0.25s).
  * There is no need to "time" your input to correspond with when an attack will
    actually hit as is convention in most action games. As soon as an enemy
    begins its attack animation, you should press the button.

For CPU-controlled characters (NPCs or [indirect mode](#indirect-controls)), the
server... [usually](../shared/magic.md)... randomly samples these parameters
from a normal distribution with some mean and variance of our choice.

### Indirect controls
We *may* have some version of this concept in the MVP if only because much of
the underlying behavior is shared with NPCs controlled by the server. You are
essentially giving NPCs orders through the same system that the AI uses to give
them orders.

The following outline gives an idea of how things might work when controlling an
army with a recursive chain of command, but as we aren't actually doing any RTS
stuff for the MVP, it's more here as a distant if (hopefully) attainable
aspiration, or in case an implementer is a passionate RTS/RTT enthusiast. The
recursive nature of the system means that the controls should still make sense
for small parties or individuals.

| **M+KB** | **Controller** | **Function** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| RMB | RT | Move to. | While in combat, characters automatically attack enemies in range, so moving to an enemy is just attacking it in melee.
| LMB | RB | Select. | <ul><li>When pointing at a character, select it. <li>Hold and drag to box select. <li>You can select characters controlled by other players and give them orders. This won't take control of their characters, but the players will see whatever you ordered them.
| <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+LMB/[`Group`](slots.md) | LB+RB/[`Group`](slots.md) | Select multiple. | <ul><li>Everything you select is added to your selection until the key is released. <li>Press a [group](slots.md) button to select whichever party member you have bound to that slot. You can select multiple before releasing. Pressing an *empty* group button binds the last selected character to that group. <li>If you select a character *twice*, you switch to that character's slot menu. In a hierarchy, a character is forced to have his commander in the same slot that the commander has *him*. Thus, you can use this to traverse the tree without having line of sight to everyone.[^4] <li>When <kbd>CTRL</kbd>/LB is held, you see all slotted party members, each with an [incapacitation wheel](../tactical/combat.md) around its portrait. When a specific character is selected, you see a more detailed summary. <ul><li>In a hierarchy, a selected character's summary includes aggregated information about everyone under his command, and the selected character gets two incapacitation wheels, the outer one being the average for everyone under his command. <li>The stats tracked might include the following: <ul><li>Morale <li>Encumbrance <li>Value of loot <li>Encumbrance (if ranged)
| MMB+Mouse | Left Stick | Rotate camera.
| <kbd>W</kbd><kbd>A</kbd><kbd>S</kbd><kbd>D</kbd> | Right Stick | Pan camera.
| Scroll | Hold Left Stick Click + Left Stick Up/Down | Adjust camera Y-level.
| <kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+LMB | | Select everything between current selection and new selection.
| <kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+RMB | LT+RT | Place waypoint.
| <kbd>SPACE</kbd>+RMB | LT+RB | Ping.
| | LT+Left Stick Click | Swoop camera to selected character.

[^4]: This is a bit awkward, but you shouldn't normally be skipping the chain of command anyway.
### Universal
These inputs would theoretically find use in both direct and indirect modes.

* Toggle [inventory](../shared/inventory.md) menu.
* Toggle logout/[character](../strategic/character.md) menu.
* Toggle [quest](../strategic/quests.md) menu.
* Toggle [rest](../shared/health.md) menu.
* Toggle direct/indirect control.
* Skip [time](../strategic/time.md).
	* In normal use, this toggles between real time and
   [sim-time](../strategic/time.md). When camped, it skips straight to the end
   of your rest. Either way, it's automatically interrupted if the party spots
   an enemy or encounters difficult terrain.
	* In the strategic layer (GSG mode), you continue to see the map at a
   consistent speed. In the direct camera or tactical layer (RTS mode), we can
   display a cinematic montage of travel or night passing. Not in MVP.
