# Procedural building prototype

This crate converts high-level building programmes into deterministic semantic
data and audited geometry. The tactical city adapter consumes its recipes and
collision meshes; the standalone viewer provides architectural inspection.

## Current boundary

`BuildingProgram` describes an archetype, footprint, storeys, requested room
functions, construction family, timber-frame system, storey projection, and
roof pitch. `generate` produces:

- connected grid-cell regions with explicit room identities;
- one canonical wall at each exterior or inter-room boundary;
- a connected interior-door graph plus exterior doors, gates, windows, and
  arrow slits;
- stable-ID polygonal roof assemblies resolved from editable roof recipes,
  with typed ridges, hips, valleys, eaves, verges, abutments and opening cuts;
- grid-anchored round tower modules with integral-cell diameters, plus straight
  or helical vertical connectors; and
- eight distinct defensive crowns, continuous wall walks, tower-top decks,
  detached curtain walls, square bell towers, and corbelled corner bartizans.

`generate` is also the public validity boundary. An `Ok(BuildingPlan)` has
passed the complete semantic and geometric audit; a recipe that cannot produce
an audit-clean building returns a typed `GenerationError::StructuralContract`
containing the audit findings. Internal unchecked construction exists only so
the generator's mutation tests can prove that this boundary rejects corrupted
plans. The fixture seed matrix continuously exercises all archetypes at zero,
adjacent, ordinary proof, large, and wrapping-boundary seeds.

The grid is topological rather than voxel geometry. Floors, wall openings,
roofs, towers, stairs, and battlements are derived structures. Circular towers
therefore do not have to pretend that their circumference is a staircase of
square cells.

Multi-storey programs declare their required vertical connections explicitly.
Before allocating ordinary rooms, the civilian solver reserves one shared
stair-and-landing core on every served storey. Walls and doors are derived
around that reservation, so a generated straight stair must arrive inside a
connected stair hall with a 0.90-metre clear landing and a real doorway into
the storey's room graph. The freeform grid remains permissive: a player-build
document can represent a blocked stair, but `generate` rejects the same result
from a procedural program.

Twelve curated programmes exercise the current vocabulary:

- `town-house`: narrow, two-storey timber-frame house with a steep street gable;
- `hall-house`: broad hall plan beneath a steep half-hip roof;
- `fachwerk-cottage`: compact two-storey dwelling with close-studded timber
  framing and a different window rhythm from the merchant house;
- `fachwerk-merchant-house`: three projecting storeys, dense early-modern
  ornamental bracing, a street gable, cross-roof mass, and mixed dormers;
- `renaissance-town-hall`: a broad civic building with an intersecting
  half-hip and cross-gable roofscape, a transverse wall dormer, smaller roof
  dormers, and stepped or curved gable details;
- `workplace`: a working barn fixture; settlement uses select the other working programmes described below;
- `parish-church`: a modest single-storey masonry church with nave, chancel and sacristy; and
- `cathedral`: an east-oriented, four-bay, three-aisled cruciform basilica with
  a projecting transept, square crossing, two-bay choir, five-sided apse, and
  an integrated single west bell tower;
- `castle-gatehouse`: gate passage, paired round towers, spiral stairs, arrow
  slits, bartizans, a projecting machicolated gallery, localized bretèche, and
  an open timber hoarding; and
- `courtyard-castle`: four wings around an open court, four corner towers,
  multiple roof pieces and dormers, permanent stone parapets, and unroofed
  fighting towers; and
- `walled-keep`: a detached central keep inside a gated outer curtain with
  four accessible corner towers and fighting platforms on both defensive
  layers; and
- `artillery-rondel-castle`: a retained medieval keep inside an earth-backed
  1544 retrofit with four rondels, a dry ditch, and a deniable bridge.

## Interactive editor

The native viewer can edit the same high-level authority used by generation:

```powershell
cargo run -p adventuresim-building-generator --bin building-viewer -- `
  --editor --document building-document.json
```

Middle-drag orbits, Shift+middle-drag pans, the wheel zooms, and `F` frames the
current selection. Resolved walls, openings, and timber framing map back to
stable grid selectors; hovering uses a grey outline and selection a white one.
The property window can add or remove wall openings, change eligible civilian
wall finishes, and change a timber-frame program. The **Fixtures** menu lists
every curated fixture. Switching fixtures replaces the building while keeping
the current camera, lighting, and editor scene in place. If neither a fixture
nor an existing document is supplied at launch, the editor starts with the
town-house fixture.

The editor uses a build-mode shell: a mode strip exposes Select, Construct,
Openings, Roof, Site, and Finish, while a storey rail presents the current
storey and wall visibility state. The roof is the virtual storey immediately
above the highest occupied floor, not an independent visibility toggle.
`1`–`6`, `Esc`, `Page Up`, `Page Down`, `Home`, `Ctrl+Z`, and `Ctrl+Y` mirror
those visible controls.
The current `BuildingDocument` remains the strict procedural-programme path:
only Select, Openings, and Finish activate an audited edit today. With a
freeform player-build document loaded, Construct adds a wall tool: drag across
the scene to snap its endpoints to the build grid and place the corresponding
per-cell semantic wall segments. The **Floor tile** tool places semantic room
cells; adjacent cells classify a wall as interior, while a freestanding wall
has two exterior faces. A freeform save contains the same pre-mesh
assembly as the generated plan—storeys, walls, openings, roof recipes, and
per-wall finishes—not render cuboids. **Detach generated building** copies
that assembly into a freeform document; the detached build no longer has a
programme to edit. Timber/frame walls use the generated wall renderer, so
their plaster infill and fachwerk stay one wall feature and obey wall
visibility together.

The exterior wall finish and room-side finish are separate properties. New
freeform interiors use thin plastered partitions by default; boarding and
exposed internal framing are explicit choices rather than automatic copies of
the exterior fachwerk.

## Headless editor test ABI

Freeform editor mutations have a typed JSON command ABI for deterministic
tests and debugging. Run a script without opening a window:

```powershell
cargo run -p adventuresim-building-generator --bin building-viewer -- `
  --editor-script editor-actions.json
```

The command writes one JSON snapshot per action to standard output. Each
selection, advisory findings, status, and any error. UI freeform mutations and
the script runner share the same player-build edit reducer.
snapshot contains the active storey, visibility state, freeform assembly
summary, selection, advisory findings, status, and any error. UI freeform
mutations and the script runner share the same player-build edit reducer.
selection, advisory findings, status, and any error. UI freeform mutations and
the script runner share the same player-build edit reducer.
`draw_wall` accepts start/end metres, material, and storey; it uses the same
grid snapping and cardinal-axis rule as the Construct-mode drag tool.

`BuildingDocument` is versioned JSON containing a `BuildingProgram` plus an
ordered edit log. Each UI command regenerates the complete plan and runs the
same audit as `generate`; an invalid command reports an error and leaves the
current document and scene unchanged. Undo and redo operate on document
snapshots. Save and load never serialize resolved meshes, which remain derived
evidence rather than a parallel editing authority.

The timber renderer treats *Fachwerk* as a structural system rather than a
painted facade. Its three patterns can place continuous sills and wall plates,
posts and close studs, horizontal rails, long diagonal braces, K-like braces,
Andreaskreuze, and the four-brace Mann figure. Upper storeys can project beyond
the wall below on visible timber brackets. Gable triangles receive their own
tie beams, king posts, collar beams, vertical studs, and outward braces.
Window-bearing bays are generated separately: their rails align with the sill
and lintel, structural studs flank the opening, and short braces stay in the
panels above or below rather than crossing the glazing.

Civilian windows are real wall openings with thin glazing recessed behind the
outer wall face. Separate jamb, sill, lintel, mullion, and transom meshes make
the depth and subdivision legible. Doors and gates are similarly recessed.
The curated castle fixtures instead treat their exposed exterior envelope as
defensive: ordinary apertures are narrow firing loops with no glazing. Flat
walls are split around the loop, round-tower shells omit surface facets at the
loop positions, and a darker inner embrasure surface sits behind the opening.
Pierced merlons and gun-loop parapets remain legacy, unaccepted vocabulary
until the resolver can prove their through-openings; curated military fixtures
use the ordinary masonry crown rather than silently substituting geometry.

The defensive vocabulary currently comprises ordinary crenellation, pierced
merlons, projecting masonry machicolation, open and roofed timber hoardings,
covered wall walks, continuous gun-loop parapets, localized bretèches, and
roofed or open bartizans. These remain semantic plan objects; the renderer does
not collapse them into a generic decorative crenel strip. Curated projected
defenses additionally resolve their host masonry, sockets, portals, support
bonds, floors, and drains into the renderer-independent geometry layer.

Every full battlement run now has an explicit 1.25-metre wall-walk surface on
the protected side of its parapet. Battlemented round towers have annular top
decks with open stair wells, and their spiral stairs rise to deck level. The
plan also records each constructed junction between fighting surfaces as a level
landing or short flight of steps, including its usable width and headroom.
Fighting surfaces are assigned exactly once to named defensive circuits: the
courtyard has one circuit, while the walled keep distinguishes its outer curtain
from the separately accessed inner keep. Round-tower graph edges require
explicit wall-walk portals. The renderer cuts those openings through the tower
shell and crown, adds landings, and gives every spiral stair a framed ground
entrance. The dark inner cylinder visible through loops and portals is
explicitly a non-colliding depth backdrop; the cut outer shell and portal data
define the physical opening. The viewer renders the surfaces as continuous
structural slabs. They are suitable inputs for a future tactical collision or
navigation adapter, but this standalone prototype does not itself make agents
pathfind across them.

The generator runs a semantic military-structure audit over every curated
plan. It rejects inward-facing parapets, unsupported battlements, missing or
undersized wall walks, roof-obstructed tower crowns, tower decks without stair
access, missing physical tower portals, multiply assigned or internally
disconnected fighting circuits, vertical discontinuities without usable steps,
narrow or low junctions, roof intrusions over wall walks, and curtain walls
without outward-facing parapets. Screenshot
manifests include the result and fail validation when the plan audit fails.
The renderer also audits geometry declared to be a closed solid: quantized
triangle edges expose boundary holes, non-manifold edges, inconsistent winding
(a common cause of visible backfaces), and degenerate triangles. Purposefully
open architectural surfaces remain classified separately until they acquire
volumetric construction.

These are coarse structural studies, not finished historical reconstructions.
The generator does not yet solve arbitrary polygon roofs with a general
straight-skeleton implementation, wall damage, navigation, or construction
chronology. Curated rectangles, L/courtyard compositions, dormers,
facade-derived cross gables, towers and cathedral aisle/nave hierarchies are
resolved into clipped face graphs with explicit framing, support contacts,
weathering and drainage. Pitch handles recompute those graphs under a declared
pivot policy and reject topology changes they cannot preserve.

## Captures

Render an exterior:

```powershell
just building-capture town-house exterior target/building-captures/town-house-exterior.png
```

Render a cutaway that exposes rooms and stairs:

```powershell
just building-capture castle-gatehouse cutaway target/building-captures/castle-gatehouse-cutaway.png
```

Audit rear and side defensive crowns from an elevated angle:

```powershell
just building-capture courtyard-castle defenses target/building-captures/courtyard-defenses.png
```

The military fixtures also provide deterministic proof views for the gate and
tower circulation contracts:

```powershell
just building-capture walled-keep gate-detail-exterior target/building-captures/walled-keep-gate-detail-exterior.png
just building-capture walled-keep gate-detail-interior target/building-captures/walled-keep-gate-detail-interior.png
just building-capture courtyard-castle tower-portal-detail target/building-captures/courtyard-tower-portal-detail.png
```

Each PNG is accompanied by a `.plan.json` containing the complete generated
recipe and a `.capture.json` describing what the screenshot was meant to show,
including focused component indices, daylight settings, luminance separation,
and clipping checks. Opaque architectural materials and the ground use a
shadowed oblique key with cool ambient fill; diagnostic void material alone is
unlit. The gate interior uses the same rig from the open section side so its
mechanism remains inspectable.
The viewer performs a disposable readback before the recorded screenshot so a
camera transition cannot be mistaken for the requested view.
After producing the nine crown proof files, validate that they all came from
one source revision and dirty-source fingerprint and that every view of a
fixture has identical plan and resolved-geometry hashes:

```powershell
target\debug\building-viewer.exe --validate-crown-suite target/building-captures
```

The Stage 4 roof proof matrix additionally validates 50 focused roof views and
all nine full-building regressions. Roof faces, child cuts, edge treatments,
supports, wall/tower contact contours, gutters and outlets retain exact IDs and
renderer fingerprints. Cathedral aisle sheds terminate against authoritative
clerestory wall faces, while the bell tower cuts and flashes the parent nave
roof rather than overlapping it as an independent solid.

Roof drainage deliberately uses a bounded MVP vocabulary. Adjacent face
catchments feed shared perimeter or ring stations, with no more than four
stations per roof assembly. A station either reaches a supported downspout on
an opening-free planar facade, free-drips vertically onto a named point that
is contained by and lies on an exact parent-roof face, or free-drips to a named
ground splash area when no safe facade host exists. Parent-roof free-drip is a
narrow child-eave case, not a general arbitrary recipient solver; intermediate
roof hits or solids reject it. Ground free-drip sweeps its fall and splash clear
of architecture and circulation.
The audit rejects pipes crossing openings, portals, stairs, defensive walks, or
accessible tower stages. Decorative leader heads, buried drainage, and radial
tower plumbing are deferred until they provide more architectural value than
their additional topology and clearance cases; the prototype does not emulate
them with detached rods or one pipe per roof facet.

```powershell
target\debug\building-viewer.exe --validate-roof-suite target/building-captures
```

The Stage 5 church program makes the cathedral's bay system authoritative
rather than inferring it from a picturesque roof shell. Each nave axis owns
paired piers, arcades, buttresses, clerestory lights, vault shells, and load
surfaces. The crossing, choir, radial apse supports, west portal, nave passage,
guarded spiral, bearing-ring bell floor, bell frame, unglazed louvres, and roof
service ladder retain stable resolved IDs and grounded support paths. The
westwork floor is borne by the tower-wall nodes; it is not declared grounded
merely because it occurs inside the tower.

Thirty deterministic church views cover the whole building, a representative
nave bay, crossing, choir/apse, bell tower, drainage, and support graph.
Validate that they share one current program and resolved geometry authority
with:

```powershell
target\debug\building-viewer.exe --validate-church-suite target/building-captures/stage5-church-proof-v1
```

This is intentionally a coarse structural type, not a universal cathedral
grammar. Ornate tracery, sculpture, pinnacles, carved portals, detailed rib
profiles and bosses, crypts, chapels, sacristies, furnishings, acoustics, brick
textures, and underground drainage remain explicitly deferred. They are not
represented by decorative witnesses or semantic booleans.

## Research decisions

The first roof iteration uses editable roof pieces rather than immediately
attempting a general roof solver. This follows the useful interaction boundary
of *The Sims 4*: rooms, walls, stairs, and roofs remain independently movable
architectural elements. EA also described an experimental automatic-door
placement pass, supporting the separation between semantic layout and later
opening placement:

- [EA: early concepts from The Sims 4](https://www.ea.com/news/see-early-concept-art-from-the-sims-4)
- [Maxis Build Mode design summary](https://simscommunity.info/2014/06/05/building-anticipation-for-the-sims-4/)

The room allocator follows a data-first room-graph approach: seed requested
functions, expand only through adjacent unclaimed cells, derive shared
boundaries, and then select a spanning set of interior doors. A later arbitrary
polygon roof should use a weighted straight skeleton, whose wavefront directly
produces roof ridges and supports different edge speeds or pitches:

- [Aichholzer et al.: A Novel Type of Skeleton for Polygons](https://www.jucs.org/jucs_1_12/a_novel_type_of/Aichholzer_O.pdf)
- [Weighted straight skeletons for roofs and terrains](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.03362)
- [Dungeon Alchemist straight-skeleton implementation notes](https://github.com/Briganti-Games/Straight-Skeleton-Generator)

The fixture vocabulary deliberately emphasizes forms visible in German lands
around the game's 1544 setting: steep roof masses and prominent gables,
irregular castle building groups, round or polygonal stair towers, and exterior
spiral stairs as status-bearing circulation. Defensive projections distinguish
ordinary crenellation from machicolation: the latter has an overhanging gallery
and corbels so openings can address the wall foot.

The expanded civilian pass uses *Fachwerk* terminology conservatively. Posts,
sills, plates, rails, and braces are load-bearing members; an Andreaskreuz is an
X-brace, while a Mann figure combines head and foot braces around a post. The
1544 fixtures use late-medieval and early-modern systems, including
storey-by-storey construction and projection, without treating modern tourist
labels as rigid regional or ethnic categories:

- [BauNetz Wissen: Fachwerk construction and member names](https://www.baunetzwissen.de/holz/fachwissen/holzbausysteme/fachwerkbauweise-7820010)

Transverse wall dormers are modeled separately from ordinary dormers because a
Zwerchhaus continues the facade and carries a roof perpendicular to the main
ridge. Both forms belong in late-medieval and Renaissance roofscapes:

- [BauNetz Wissen: Zwerchhaus](https://www.baunetzwissen.de/glossar/z/zwerchhaus-1153505)
- [BauNetz Wissen: historical dormers](https://www.baunetzwissen.de/bauen-im-bestand/fachwissen/dach-konstruktion/historische-dachgauben-3010573)

Defensive crowns distinguish function and material. Hoardings project in
timber; machicolations replace that vulnerable gallery with masonry on corbels;
a bretèche protects a limited point such as a gate; and a bartizan is a small
overhanging turret rather than a continuous parapet:

- [World History Encyclopedia: illustrated castle-architecture glossary](https://www.worldhistory.org/article/1233/an-illustrated-glossary-of-castle-architecture/)
- [Muralla de Ávila: defensive-wall element glossary](https://muralladeavila.com/en/what-do-you-know-about-the-walls/what-is-each-part-called)

The absence of glass is a property of these defensive loops, not a universal
rule for every castle room. Residential ranges could have large windows, but
those openings weakened defense; the fixtures currently represent the exposed
gatehouse and curtain-wall condition. Firing loops stay narrow outside and
open into a deeper interior embrasure so a defender can aim from cover:

- [English Heritage: Restormel Castle arrowloops and vulnerable large windows](https://production.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/restormel-castle/history/description/)
- [Canterbury Historical and Archaeological Society: arrow-loop definition](https://www.canterbury-archaeology.org.uk/arrow-loop)

The current regular courtyard castle is one valid late-Renaissance program, not
the assumed universal castle plan. Contemporary German residences often retained
inherited, irregular building groups; future programs should add incremental
accretion rather than merely varying a symmetric four-wing seed. Its current
military crown is intentionally one continuous permanent masonry family:
ordinary crenellation runs around the curtain and all four towers, while special
protection remains localized at the gate. Pierced merlons are deferred until
their openings can be expressed as true resolved voids rather than painted
recesses. Each accepted masonry crown is an authoritative resolved assembly with
a 0.90-metre breastwork below every crenel, a 1.70-metre merlon top, coping,
open scuppers, protected inner walk edge, stance and firing lines, and owned
corner/tower splices. The walk itself is resolved as supported, outward-sloped
catchment solids and drainage surfaces. Each walk slab stops at a 0.12-metre
exposed-edge slot instead of occupying the channel volume. A separate recessed
channel floor begins below the adjacent toe, descends longitudinally through an
obstacle-checked segment chain, and turns through the breastwork only inside the
open scupper. The audit rejects a raised channel or an uncut walk slab, then
samples the full inner, middle, and outer walk width, verifies downhill
reachability, and covers all four straight-wall orientations plus 144 radial
tower angles. Round deck chords overlap at their inner edge and are sized from
the outer sector boundary so no triangular foot gaps remain. The exact
60-millimetre crossfall, 18-millimetre channel fall, and 0.12-metre slot are
prototype drainage/readability gates, not universal historical dimensions. Tower
splices resolve explicit return pieces whose measured contact area, gap and
penetration must fit the local bond prism; the audit rejects displaced and
over-penetrated bonds. These exact envelope dimensions are prototype gameplay
gates, not universal historical measurements. The same deterministic
resolved-solid IDs, support nodes, drainage routes, voids and dimensions feed
auditing and rendering. Capture manifests bind the resolver schema, exact
per-item render multiset, source revision and dirty-source fingerprint, resolved
geometry hash, and plan/evidence hashes so stale or transformed proof cannot
silently pass. The roof eaves are held behind the fighting circuit rather than
occupying its headroom. The detached walled-keep fixture uses a separate
coherent outer crenellation and inner gun-loop parapet, a 1.2-metre inferred
prototype minimum for curtain and tower masonry, and a pair of close flanking
towers at the gate. Two modeled, splayed firing apertures must geometrically
cover both the gate threshold and approach within their arcs and ranges. The
three-dimensional segment audit rejects intervening curtains, tower shells,
building walls, gate-chamber structure, closures, roofs, decks, and wall walks
after subtracting the originating aperture. Heavy gate leaves and a second
portcullis closure are operated from an explicit supported guard chamber: its
floor, walls, observation and downward openings, windlass position, and stair
connection to the wall walk are modeled and rendered rather than represented by
a capability flag. The courtyard towers use the same minimum fortified shell
profile. These numeric thickness, clearance, chamber-area, arc, and range gates
are game-design inferences for declared defensive profiles, not universal
historical rules.

The walled-keep gate is authored as one cardinal, wall-local
`GatehouseAssemblySpec`, not as independently positioned cylinders and boxes.
Its integral-cell tower diameter and parity-checked lattice anchors derive the
symmetric flanking towers, chord-cut bonded interfaces, positive-area curtain
returns, clear gate passage, segmental masonry arch and spandrel bearings,
guard-chamber volume, closures, access, openings, and firing apertures in any of
the four wall orientations. Metre-valued plans are resolved output caches; the
structural audit rejects cache drift, blocked passage or room voids, missing
bearing paths, unmatched round-to-rectangular splices, unresolved apertures, and
undeclared overlaps using resolved clear prisms, solid prisms, and chord-cut
cylinder tests. Even-cell tower centres must occupy room-grid vertices and
odd-cell tower centres must occupy cell centres; invalid numeric values are
rejected during construction and deserialization. The 1/30-cell structural
lattice and exact module dimensions are prototype construction gates, not
historical claims. The gate passage also carries an explicit
rectangular-plus-segmental-arch cross-section. Both the heavy plank leaves and
portcullis derive their local top height from that profile, and the audit
rejects any closure line that leaves an unsecured rectangular strip or arched
lunette.

Guard-chamber circulation uses a protected-side military service stair rather
than an internal flight squeezed beneath the chamber roof. Its authoritative
route contains a positively overlapping wall-walk landing, a roof-clearance
slot and upper wall opening, a supported 10-riser exterior flight with guards,
a full bottom landing, and a floor-threshold rear door with inward swing
clearance. Every exposed landing-boundary interval carries an explicit guard;
the wall-walk, stair, and door connection intervals remain open. A masonry
ledger plus transverse and longitudinal diagonal braces give the tall timber
posts a declared lateral load path. The 0.90 m traversal width, 1.90 m swept
height, 0.12–0.19 m riser,
0.25–0.34 m going, 38-degree maximum pitch, landing depth, nosing, and guard
dimensions are game/animation gates rather than historical universal values.
The audit sweeps the route against the roof and wall openings, tower solids,
murder hole, windlass operating clearance, and door swing, and verifies the
stair and landings have both vertical and lateral support paths.

Projected defenses are now resolved assemblies rather than battlement enum
decorations. Permanent masonry machicolations and localized bretèches, stored or
deployed temporary timber hoardings, and hollow usable bartizans each own their
floor pieces, downward throat voids, wall-foot rays, protected outer wall,
access portal and landing, support graph, firing apertures, roof and independent
drain where exposed. Each assembly records the exact top-storey exterior
wall-cell IDs it replaces. The resolver rebuilds those source cells inside their
original vertical envelope, splits them around real access and socket voids, and
the renderer suppresses the corresponding legacy wall cells, so a defense cannot
add a freestanding witness screen above the building. Host wall walks overlap
the access landing, and a positive-area junction bond connects the projection
supports to grounded masonry. Threatened-wall bartizans additionally bear on an
explicit grounded, wall-bonded buttress rather than claiming support from one
flat witness face. Hoarding sockets are host-masonry voids; the stored state
renders the open holes, while deployed joists occupy and embed into those same
socket IDs. No non-colliding witness wall participates in audit or proof
rendering.

Floor solids stop around every throat. Bartizan floors remain continuous around
their declared throat and access voids, while firing loops split only the narrow
lower, upper, and jamb portions of nearby shell facets instead of removing
full-height sides. Supported working positions produce independent near, middle,
and far rays from the real throat or loop plane; the audit rejects below-floor
origins and rays crossing friendly circulation. Gallery floors and roofed works
carry physical slope, feed lower disjoint channels, and reach exact open outlets
through sampled downhill paths. Lean-to roofs also have a resolved high-edge
flashing at the host junction so that edge cannot become a trapped valley. Open
masonry works use sloped, overhanging coping with outward drips; round bartizan
coping resolves and drains each shell facet independently. The localized
bretèche roof seats on two explicit wall plates: its outer enclosure rises to
the low plate, while paired rear posts carry the high plate through the gallery
support graph. The audit samples both bearing lines and rejects a raised roof or
missing, shortened, or displaced support. audit rejects a gallery slab laid
through the opening, a blocked or inward ray, unsupported corbel/frame bearings,
dangling timber, inaccessible or cramped walks, flat, raised, reversed, or
trapped drainage, closed bartizans, and incoherent material/phase or
tactical-target declarations. The 0.90-metre route, 1.90-metre headroom,
0.75-metre doorway pinch, 0.08-square-metre minimum support bearing, 0.75-metre
floor-to-support spacing and 1.20-metre timber cantilever are prototype game and
animation gates, not historical universal dimensions.

The curated gatehouse does not display every device as a catalogue. Its main
state has permanent gate-approach machicolation and sockets showing capacity
for a temporary siege-front hoarding. Deterministic isolated study states place
a bretèche at one named threatened wall foot, a deployed campaign hoarding on
another front, or bartizans at threatened corners while retaining the accepted
ordinary host crown and circulation. Capture manifests identify the exact
assembly solids, voids, ray count, deployment and tactical target; the
projected-defense suite rejects mixed source builds, stale fixture/seed hashes,
or missing proof IDs.

## Settlement building programmes

`adventuresim_world_schema::settlement_buildings` owns the building-use catalogue,
eligibility rules and approximate service catchments. `SettlementBuildingDemand`
reads the canonical economy profile: it never independently rolls for a
weaponsmith, armorer, temple, inn or other existing strategic service. Repeated
buildings cover their catchment with independently seeded capacities. Civic
singletons stay single; evidence-dependent institutions and power sites are
catalogued without being invented from population alone.

`BuildingProgram::settlement` assigns working rooms to structural families:
stalls, milling floors, kiln rooms, vats, wards, classrooms and counting rooms.
Timber town houses can combine workshops below with dwellings above. Parish
churches have their own masonry nave, chancel and sacristy recipe. The existing
cathedral remains a separate monumental architecture. Seeded roof pitches and
storey heights vary the silhouette without enlarging the reserved lot.

The tactical layout reserves service plots along connected streets before
housing residents. Market uses prefer central frontage; bulky and nuisance
trades prefer the developing edge. Every output reports unplaced services and
unhoused residents. The dispatcher rejects an incomplete city instead of
silently claiming it has met population demand. Playable and distant buildings
carry the same use and seed and reconstruct the same recipe.

Catchments describe people served over time, not seats, beds, workers or actual
resident occupancy. They are authored design values and are not historical
measurements. Water mills, windmills and regional extraction sites require a
surveyed site; their catalogue entries do not currently create waterways,
millraces, exposed hilltops or resource deposits. Their machinery is not yet a
simulated production system. Research context and the wider building inventory
are in `research/city-building-variety-1544.md`.

Export and inspect a real generated layout without starting a database:

```sh
cargo run -p adventuresim-tactical-core --bin city-layout-report -- 6500 42 > target/city.json
python scripts/render_city_layout_report.py target/city.json target/city.svg
```

The report contains each lot's identity, use, service capacity, housing capacity,
footprint and orientation, plus the actual streets and any capacity shortfalls.
The SVG gives a building inventory and plot tooltips. Runtime palettes contain
up to twelve recipes per residential family and two per service use and size, limiting
repeated structural compilation while varying ordinary street frontage.


## Working buildings and plots

Settlement recipes for barns, stables, granaries, smithies (including weaponsmith
and armorer premises), bakehouses, market halls, breweries, malt houses, timber
yards, carpenter workshops and merchant warehouses use the `Workplace`
structural family.
Their capacity band selects a small, medium or large working footprint before
city placement reserves the complete plot. Playable buildings and distant
recipes carry the same size; roofs, yard fences, sheds and major equipment
remain visible in both distant mesh representations.

The workplace programme owns its wall bays and open passages. It does not run
the residential wall/framing solver over a second copy of the envelope. Barns
have broad through-passages, stables have repeated stalls and an open working
side, and both reserve fenced yards with detached storage sheds. Granaries
have ventilation openings, an upper loading opening, storage floors and stairs.
Smithies and bakehouses have geometrically open furnace outlets and distinct
working equipment. Market halls have open post-and-beam sides and trading
counters. These are procedural architectural prototypes: machinery, fire and
business activity are not simulated by the building generator.

Parts retain stable geometry identities, material and purpose. Structural
support, reserved plot bounds, required equipment and clear passages are audited;
static collision consumes the same physical parts. Roofs continue through the
existing roof resolver and audit. Generic grid-opening edits are rejected for
this structural family; edit the working programme instead.

Breweries combine a masonry hall with a lower timber service shelter, open
coopered vessels and a separate firing area. Malt houses have long ventilated
walls and an external drying kiln. Timber yards are open stock shelters with
separated timber stacks and handling lanes; joinery workshops keep an enclosed
rear workshop behind a deep open working bay. These forms distinguish working
space and rooflines, while capacity bands extend the useful bays rather than
enlarging tools. Armorer premises share the smithy's forge programme.

Warehouses have a long two-level masonry body, repeated ventilation and loading
bays, and a covered loading apron with a hoist. A separate clear cart lane
passes outside the loading shelter; the upper storage floor has an internal
stair. The long masonry storage form draws on the fifteenth-century
[Kornhofspeicher in Erfurt](https://www.denkmalschutz.de/denkmal/kornhofspeicher-grosse-ackerhofgasse-11-12.html).
The loading arrangement is a procedural design, not a reconstruction of that
specific building.

The structural audit memoizes completed support paths. Stacked boards and
other assemblies can share bearings without repeatedly expanding the same
ancestry. Every ungrounded member still requires all declared parents to exist
and reach ground through an acyclic graph.

Capture the working families with the production tactical renderer:

```powershell
python scripts/capture_workplaces.py --output target/workplace-review
```

The checked-in `assets/tactical-scenes/workplace-review.json` supplies building
programmes and placements. Its `.review.json` companion supplies camera targets.
Exterior, intact interior and distant shots exercise production materials,
operable door/window presentation, lighting, post-processing and automatic LODs.
Edit these inputs to review another recipe; the capture layer contains no material
mapping or building mesh conversion. Geometry editors and their cutaways remain
useful diagnostics, but do not certify in-game appearance.

### Remaining architectural opportunities

The building-use catalogue is broader than the physical programmes. A different
room name or painted shop sign does not imply a distinct building envelope.
The next useful additions are:

- Mills: an actual horse sweep, waterwheel and race, or braced post-mill body
  and sails. Water-powered forms need surveyed water siting before placement.
- Storage and trade: drying structures for woad, open cooper and wheelwright
  work bays, wet yards for dyers and
  tanners, and kiln/drying sheds for potters and brickmakers.
- Public frontages: covered weighing bays, inn carriage passages, guard porches,
  prison bars, and a smaller chapel programme. Weigh houses, guildhalls,
  universities and mints still share the town-hall family; inns and
  several shops still share merchant-house architecture.
- Institutional plots: connected ranges, courts and covered passages for
  hospitals, monasteries and universities. Their current room programmes do
  not yet supply these arrangements.

Ordinary domestic trades can continue to share houses. Work openings, shutters,
covered frontage and useful yard space can identify their occupations without
turning every business into a landmark.

## Text-only shop signs

The `signs` module derives sign attachment sites from public ground-floor
entrances. Public-facing trades receive stable establishment brands from the
shared German name catalog and placed-lot identity, independently of cached
building recipes. A brand does not create or imply an NPC ownership relation.

Signs use a wall board or a double-sided projecting board with metal supports.
Panels stay above pedestrian headroom and are rejected when they overlap the
resolved building geometry. These are static presentation fixtures; they do not
add tactical collision, swinging physics, or sign interactions. They do not
change building footprints or service eligibility.

The optional `sign-render` feature provides the same GPU components to the
client and the review binary. The client loads lettering within 48 metres,
fades it over 35–45 metres and releases lettering entities beyond 60 metres.
The texture cache retains at most 64 painted materials; boards remain visible.
Grenze Gotisch Bold is the default, with UnifrakturCook available for comparison.
Fonts and their licenses are bundled locally. Long names wrap onto two lines.

```powershell
python scripts/capture_shop_signs.py --output target/shop-sign-review
```

The shop review fixture covers both fonts and mounts, reverse reading, long
German names, street context, the mounting contact, glazed windows, plaster and
production distance LODs. Sign plates require complete contact with a structural
face; short beams use a horizontal plate. The arm reaches from that face to the
board's separately calculated facade clearance.

Both review scripts build and run `tactical-scene-viewer`, which installs the
same `TacticalPresentationPlugin` as the game. The removed standalone review
binaries must not be recreated. Review inputs may choose entities and cameras;
only production presentation binds materials, compiles GPU meshes and sets LODs.
Capture waits for production geometry, textures and nearby lettering, checks
window glass and per-building material bindings, and fails if required inputs or
assets are missing. Production atmosphere baking waits for completed GPU
generation and filtering before freezing its sky and lighting textures; allocated
image handles alone do not establish readiness.
`manifest.json` records camera, revision and lighting checks;
`building-presentation.json` records the actual graphics adapter, backend and
configuration. These are native GPU captures. Browser rendering requires its own
smoke run against the actual web client; a native gallery is not WebGPU evidence.
