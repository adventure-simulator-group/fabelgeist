//! Audited semantic and geometric recipes for procedural buildings.
//!
//! This crate intentionally has no dependency on either the strategic or the
//! tactical runtime. It turns a high-level [`BuildingProgram`] into a bounded,
//! deterministic [`BuildingPlan`] consumed by the viewer and tactical city adapter.
