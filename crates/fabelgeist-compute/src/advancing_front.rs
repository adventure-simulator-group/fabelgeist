//! GPU advancing-front extraction for implicit surfaces.
//!
//! On a regular distance-field lattice, every sign-changing lattice edge is an
//! active front.  The four incident cells supply projected vertex candidates;
//! joining those candidates closes the front with two triangles.  Ownership by
//! lattice edge makes the candidates non-overlapping, which is the structured
//! grid equivalent of SAFT's collision/selection phase.
//!
//! The underlying surface-front pipeline is shared with dual contouring: gather
//! finds active cells/fronts, scan allocates compact output ranges, and stream
//! projects candidates and emits triangles.  Keeping this specialization as a
//! thin facade avoids maintaining a second copy of the sizeable WGSL kernels.
