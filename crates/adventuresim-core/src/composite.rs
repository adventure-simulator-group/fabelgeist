/// A composite type that holds all aspects of a player's state.
///
/// ## Composite Nature
///
/// `PlayerInfo<At, Bd, Es, Eq, Sl>` is generic over five type parameters:
/// - `At` - Player attributes (implements [`PlayerAttributes`])
/// - `Bd` - Player body (implements [`PlayerBody`])
/// - `Es` - Player essentials like calories and focus (implements [`PlayerEssentials`])
/// - `Eq` - Player equipment (implements [`PlayerEquipment`])
/// - `Sl` - Player skills (implements [`PlayerSkills`])
///
/// By default, each part is `()`, meaning it's not present. When a part is
/// present (not `()`), methods from the corresponding trait become available.
///
/// ## Example: Building a Player
///
/// ```
/// # use adventuresim_core::prelude::*;
/// # use adventuresim_core::stub::{StubAttributes, StubBody, StubEssentials, StubEquipment, StubSkills};
/// // Start with an empty player
/// let player = PlayerInfo::empty();
///
/// // Add attributes
/// let player = player.with_attributes(StubAttributes);
///
/// // Add body
/// let player = player.with_body(StubBody);
///
/// // Add essentials
/// let player = player.with_essentials(StubEssentials);
///
/// // Add equipment
/// let player = player.with_equipment(StubEquipment);
///
/// // Add skills
/// let player = player.with_skills(StubSkills);
///
/// // The builder records every component in the resulting composite type.
/// let _: PlayerInfo<StubAttributes, StubBody, StubEssentials, StubEquipment, StubSkills> = player;
/// ```
///
/// ## Trait Methods Available Based on Parts
///
/// When a part is present, you can use methods from the corresponding trait:
/// - If `At: PlayerAttributes`:  use [`PlayerAttributes::attr`] to get attribute values
/// - If `Bd: PlayerBody`:  use [`PlayerBody::body_part_health`] and [`PlayerBody::body_weight`]
/// - If `Es: PlayerEssentials`:  use [`PlayerEssentials::calories_used_today`] and [`PlayerEssentials::focus_level`]
/// - If `Eq: PlayerEquipment`:  use [`PlayerEquipment::armor_dodgerm`] to get equipment penalties
/// - If `Sl: PlayerSkills`:  use [`PlayerSkills::skill_hours_trained`] to get training hours
///
/// ```
/// # use adventuresim_core::prelude::*;
/// # use adventuresim_core::stub::{StubAttributes, StubBody, StubSkills};
/// // Create a player with attributes and skills
/// let player = PlayerInfo::empty()
///     .with_attributes(StubAttributes)
///     .with_body(StubBody)
///     .with_skills(StubSkills);
///
/// // We can call PlayerAttributes methods via the trait
/// let _strength = player.attr(LimbAttribute::Strength);
///
/// // We can call PlayerSkills methods via the trait
/// let _hours = player.skill_hours_trained(Skill::Sword);
/// ```
///
/// ## Combined/Shorthand Methods
///
/// When multiple parts are present, additional convenience methods become available
/// that combine data from multiple parts. For example, [`PlayerInfo::skill_check`] combines
/// skills, attributes, essentials, and equipment to compute a skill check result.
///
/// This is more convenient than calling [`PlayerSkills::skill_check_by_parts`]
/// directly, which requires passing all parts as separate arguments.
///
/// ```
/// # use adventuresim_core::prelude::*;
/// # use adventuresim_core::stub::{StubAttributes, StubBody, StubEssentials, StubEquipment, StubSkills};
/// let attributes = StubAttributes;
/// let body = StubBody;
/// let essentials = StubEssentials;
/// let equipment = StubEquipment;
/// let skills = StubSkills;
/// let weights = LimbWeights::all_equal();
///
/// // Calling skill_check_by_parts explicitly uses the same component values.
/// let check_explicit = skills.skill_check_by_parts(
///     Skill::Sword,
///     &attributes,
///     &body,
///     &essentials,
///     &equipment,
///     weights,
/// );
///
/// // Build player with all required parts for skill_check
/// let player = PlayerInfo::empty()
///     .with_attributes(attributes)
///     .with_body(body)
///     .with_essentials(essentials)
///     .with_equipment(equipment)
///     .with_skills(skills);
///
/// // Use the shorthand - combines skills, attributes, essentials, and equipment internally
/// let check = player.skill_check(Skill::Sword, weights);
///
/// assert_eq!(check, check_explicit);
/// ```
///
/// Another example: [`PlayerInfo::fatigue`] combines essentials and attributes:
///
/// ```
/// # use adventuresim_core::prelude::*;
/// # use adventuresim_core::stub::{StubAttributes, StubBody, StubEssentials};
/// let attributes = StubAttributes;
/// let body = StubBody;
/// let essentials = StubEssentials;
///
/// // Calling fatigue_by_parts explicitly uses the same component values.
/// let fatigue_explicit = essentials.fatigue_by_parts(&attributes, &body);
///
/// let player = PlayerInfo::empty()
///     .with_attributes(attributes)
///     .with_body(body)
///     .with_essentials(essentials);
///
/// // Shorthand method
/// let fatigue = player.fatigue();
///
/// assert_eq!(fatigue, fatigue_explicit);
/// ```
