//! Typed, deterministic generation for investigation-led quests.
//!
//! The public API remains at `quest_generation::*`; implementation source is
//! ordered as model, player-safe projection, solver, assembly, validation,
//! audit, and tests.

//! Implementation is partitioned by behavior domain below. The fragments
//! intentionally share this module scope so public paths, declaration order,
//! privacy, and macro-generated SpacetimeDB names remain unchanged.
