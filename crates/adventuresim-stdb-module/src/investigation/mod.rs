//! Private investigation authority and observer-safe gateway projections.

//! Implementation is partitioned by behavior domain below. The fragments
//! intentionally share this module scope because SpacetimeDB discovers table,
//! reducer, and view macros in this module and generates accessor names from
//! that scope. Moving those declarations into ordinary child modules changes
//! generated bindings. Macro-free calculations remain grouped with the
//! authority or observer-safe projection that owns them; tests are partitioned
//! by evidence, projection, site/action, and authority behavior.
